# LO Package Collection

`packages-lo/` is the home for reusable LO packages in this beta workspace.
It is split from ordinary app/vendor packages.

Current beta rule:

```text
packages/       normal app/vendor package space
packages-lo/    LO package collection and beta LO package experiments
```

The long-term direction is:

```text
my-lo-app/
|-- package.json       normal app/runtime ecosystem dependencies
|-- package-lo.json    LO package manifest
|-- lo.lock.json       locked LO package graph
|-- packages/          normal vendor/app packages
|-- packages-lo/       LO packages, optionally a nested Git repository
|-- boot.lo
`-- main.lo
```

`packages-lo/` may later become its own Git repository or submodule. If a
`.git` directory is added, it must be intentional and documented.

## Production Boundary

Production app installs should only fetch LO packages required by the selected
runtime profile. Development-only packages, staging packages, diagnostics,
generators and experimental packages should require an explicit development or
staging profile.

## Naming

Package names follow the family-prefix rule documented in
`../docs/PACKAGE_NAMING.md`.

Use:

```text
lo-[family]-[purpose]
```

Development-only packages should use `lo-devtools-*` or `lo-tools-*` so they are
not mistaken for production runtime dependencies.
