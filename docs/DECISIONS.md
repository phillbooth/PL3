## Decisions

### Keep Low-Bit AI Syntax Backend-Neutral

**Date:** 2026-05-08

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**

Microsoft BitNet provides optimized 1-bit/1.58-bit LLM inference, with
CPU-focused support that is useful when GPU, NPU or other accelerators are not
available. BitNet b1.58 uses ternary weights, which resembles LO `Tri` values
but does not have the same language-level meaning.

**Decision:**

LO will model low-bit AI as a generic compute target through `low_bit_ai` and
`ternary_ai`. BitNet is an optional backend inside `lo-lowbit-ai`, not a source
syntax target and not part of `lo-core` or `lo-logic`. Generic AI inference
contracts belong in `lo-ai`. CPU fallback planning belongs in `lo-target-cpu`,
and optimized CPU kernel contracts belong in `lo-cpu-kernels`.

**Reason:**

This keeps LO CPU/binary compatible by default while allowing a faster local AI
path for compatible low-bit models. It also avoids locking LO source syntax to
one named backend that could later be replaced. Language semantics stay in
`lo-core` and `lo-logic`, while AI inference and CPU kernel concerns live in
dedicated packages.

**Consequences:**

Compute policies may select `low_bit_ai` or `ternary_ai` as AI inference
fallbacks and must report the selected backend. AI output remains untrusted by
default and cannot directly authorize high-impact actions.

### Keep Project Graph Backends Swappable

**Date:** 2026-05-08

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**

Graphify-style tooling can help LO generate project knowledge graphs from code,
docs and other project material. However, Graphify is an implementation choice
that may be replaced by another graph tool or LO-native scanner later.

**Decision:**

LO will expose generic project graph commands and contracts such as `lo graph`,
graph nodes, graph edges, graph reports and graph backend policy. Graphify may
be used as an optional backend, including from a pinned Git package, but it must
not become LO syntax or a required CLI command.

**Reason:**

This keeps LO project graph output stable while allowing the underlying graph
backend to change. It also prevents AI/tooling support from becoming a compiler
or runtime authority.

**Consequences:**

Project graph backends must be selected by policy. Git-sourced backends must be
explicitly allowed and pinned. Model-assisted extraction remains opt-in and
reported.
