# Project Graph

## Summary

LO should support project maps as optional developer tooling. The goal is to
help humans and AI assistants understand package ownership, documentation
links, policies, reports and design decisions without treating the graph as a
compiler or runtime authority.

## Package

```text
packages/lo-project-graph
```

The package owns graph contracts for:

```text
Package
Document
Flow
Type
Effect
Policy
UnsafeFeature
Report
Target
CompilerRule
RuntimeRule
SecurityRule
ComputeFeature
Decision
```

## Backend-Neutral Rule

Do not make developers write Graphify-specific LO syntax or commands. Keep the
stable surface generic:

```bash
lo graph
lo graph --out build/graph
lo graph query "Which package owns SecureString?"
```

Backend selection belongs in policy/configuration:

```text
project_graph {
  backend auto
  allow ["lo_native", "graphify", "future_standard"]
}
```

This lets LO use:

```text
lo_native today
graphify as an optional pinned Git backend
another graph backend later
```

without changing LO source, CLI commands or generated graph file names.

If a backend is loaded from Git, it must be explicitly allowed and pinned to a
commit, tag or versioned ref. Model-assisted extraction remains opt-in.

## Outputs

Recommended generated output paths:

```text
build/graph/lo-project-graph.json
build/graph/lo-project-graph.html
build/graph/LO_GRAPH_REPORT.md
build/graph/lo-ai-map.md
```

## CLI Direction

Current command:

```bash
lo graph
lo graph --out build/graph
```

Planned future query commands:

```bash
lo graph --html
lo graph --json
lo graph --report
lo graph query "Which package owns SecureString?"
lo graph explain lo-security
lo graph path lo-api-server lo-security
```

## Safety Rules

Project graphs must not:

```text
replace compiler checks
replace security reports
replace runtime enforcement
be required for production runtime
leak secrets into graph nodes or reports
silently send code, docs or media to model APIs
```

Project graph scans should:

```text
redact secrets by default
mark relationship confidence as EXTRACTED, INFERRED or AMBIGUOUS
make model-assisted extraction opt-in
record generated output paths
distinguish source facts from inferred relationships
```

## Boundary

The graph explains LO. It does not enforce LO.
