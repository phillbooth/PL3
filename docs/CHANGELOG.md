# Changelog

All notable changes to this app should be documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Documented the completed move of LO packages from `packages/` to
  `packages-lo/`, with `packages/` reserved for normal app/vendor package
  space.
- Added `docs/PACKAGE_NAMING.md` with naming prefix rules, staged rename
  candidates and future `lo-io-*` package guidance.
- Documented the current workspace as a beta prototype rather than a stable
  release.
- Documented repository-maintained structure as authoritative over generated
  document suggestions, while allowing roadmap version labels to move.
- Added `lo-devtools-*` and `lo-tools-*` naming for development-only, staging,
  diagnostic and experimental packages that production applications should not
  download by default.
- Added `docs/PACKAGE_LAYOUT.md` for the proposed `package-lo.json`,
  `lo.lock.json`, `packages/` and `packages-lo/` split.
- Added `docs/FINANCE_PACKAGES.md` and `packages-lo/lo-finance-core/` as a grouped
  beta finance package area covering finance maths, market data, FIX, audit,
  risk, pricing and desktop interoperability boundaries.
- Added `packages-lo/lo-core/docs/lo-vs-fsharp.md` to position LO honestly against
  F# as a beta, security-first, AI-readable and target-aware backend language
  concept rather than a production .NET competitor.

### Changed

- Renamed the generic `packages-lo/app/` folder to
  `packages-lo/lo-framework-example-app/` so the package collection does not contain an
  ambiguous `app` package name.
- Updated workspace documentation and configuration to use `packages-lo/lo-core/`
  for the LO language package.
- Renamed the legacy language install script to `install-lo.sh`.
- Clarified that LO core is the language/compiler layer, while the Secure App
  Kernel is the optional runtime layer and full frameworks remain separate.
- Clarified that `lo-framework-api-server` serves HTTP and delegates validation, auth and
  typed execution to `lo-framework-app-kernel`.
- Documented the future split-repository layout where `packages-lo/` can become
  its own reusable Git repository imported by multiple frameworks.
- Added simple `console.log("...")` output support to LO core checked Run Mode.
- Expanded `lo-core-compute` target selection contracts with `low_bit_ai`,
  `cpu.generic`, AI inference workload planning and compute-auto selection
  reporting.
- Clarified that BitNet ternary model weights are separate from LO `Tri`
  semantics.
- Reworked low-bit AI target naming so LO source uses generic `low_bit_ai` and
  `ternary_ai` targets instead of backend-specific BitNet syntax.
- Completed initial `lo-ai`, `lo-ai-lowbit`, `lo-target-cpu` and
  `lo-cpu-kernels` contracts with validation helpers, examples and tests.
- Completed initial `lo-core-compute` offload planning reports, low-bit AI fallback
  example and test coverage.
- Added a placeholder `lo graph` CLI command entry for future project graph
  generation and querying.
- Implemented the initial `lo graph` command to generate project graph JSON and
  a Markdown graph report from `lo.workspace.json`.
- Clarified that project graph syntax and CLI commands are backend-neutral, with
  Graphify treated as an optional swappable backend rather than LO syntax.
- Expanded `lo-devtools-project-graph` with a LO-native workspace scanner that maps
  packages, documents, exported TypeScript contracts, package references and
  generated graph report outputs.
- Added graph query, explain and path helpers to `lo-devtools-project-graph` and exposed
  them through `lo graph query`, `lo graph explain` and `lo graph path`.
- Updated workspace package mapping so `lo-tools-benchmark` is tracked by the project
  graph and package registry.
- Added `optical_io` to compute, benchmark and photonic target planning
  contracts as an interconnect-aware data movement target.
- Added generic `ai_accelerator` planning support and an Intel Gaudi 3 backend
  profile to AI accelerator, compute and benchmark contracts.
