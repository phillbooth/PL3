- Added `packages/lo-target-photonic/` for photonic backend target planning.
- Added `packages/lo-compiler/` for compiler pipeline contracts.
- Added `packages/lo-runtime/` for checked and compiled execution contracts.
- Added `packages/lo-security/` for reusable security primitives and report
  contracts.
- Added `packages/lo-config/` for project configuration and environment mode
  contracts.
- Added `packages/lo-reports/` for shared report schemas and report-writing
  contracts.
- Added TODO documents for `packages/lo-api-server/` and
  `packages/lo-app-kernel/`.
- Added README and TODO documents for `packages/app/`.
- Added CLI and task runner requirements in
  `packages/lo-cli-and-lo-tasks-requirements.md`.
- Added `lo-config` project config parsing, environment mode loading,
  production strictness policy, safe environment variable references, runtime
  handoff contracts, examples and tests.
- Added `lo-reports` shared report metadata, diagnostic summaries, build,
  security, target, runtime, task and AI guide report contracts with examples
  and tests.
- Added `packages/lo-ai/` for generic AI inference contracts, safety policy and
  AI inference reports.
- Added `packages/lo-lowbit-ai/` for low-bit and ternary AI inference contracts,
  with BitNet represented as an optional backend.
- Added `packages/lo-target-cpu/` for CPU capability, fallback and execution
  planning contracts.
- Added `packages/lo-cpu-kernels/` for optimized CPU kernel contracts.
- Added a low-bit AI backend architecture note.
- Added `packages/lo-project-graph/` for project knowledge graph contracts,
  graph scan policy, output manifests and AI assistant map support.

### Changed

- Updated workspace documentation and configuration to use `packages/lo-core/`
  for the LO language package.
- Renamed the legacy language install script to `install-lo.sh`.
- Clarified that LO core is the language/compiler layer, while the Secure App
  Kernel is the optional runtime layer and full frameworks remain separate.
- Clarified that `lo-api-server` serves HTTP and delegates validation, auth and
  typed execution to `lo-app-kernel`.
- Documented the future split-repository layout where `packages/` can become
  its own reusable Git repository imported by multiple frameworks.
- Added simple `console.log("...")` output support to LO core checked Run Mode.
- Expanded `lo-compute` target selection contracts with `low_bit_ai`,
  `cpu.generic`, AI inference workload planning and compute-auto selection
  reporting.
- Clarified that BitNet ternary model weights are separate from LO `Tri`
  semantics.
- Reworked low-bit AI target naming so LO source uses generic `low_bit_ai` and
  `ternary_ai` targets instead of backend-specific BitNet syntax.
- Completed initial `lo-ai`, `lo-lowbit-ai`, `lo-target-cpu` and
  `lo-cpu-kernels` contracts with validation helpers, examples and tests.
- Completed initial `lo-compute` offload planning reports, low-bit AI fallback
  example and test coverage.
- Added a placeholder `lo graph` CLI command entry for future project graph
  generation and querying.
- Implemented the initial `lo graph` command to generate project graph JSON and
  a Markdown graph report from `lo.workspace.json`.
- Clarified that project graph syntax and CLI commands are backend-neutral, with
  Graphify treated as an optional swappable backend rather than LO syntax.
