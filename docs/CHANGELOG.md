All notable changes to this app should be documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added `packages-logicn/logicn-core/docs/cpp-rust-maturity-gap.md` to track
  missing LogicN language-core maturity items compared with modern C++ and Rust,
  including compiler pipeline, traits/protocols, deterministic cleanup, FFI,
  package management, testing, async runtime, source-mapped runtime errors and
  standard library work.
- Added `packages-logicn/logicn-core/docs/compliance-and-privacy.md` plus the
  `logicn-compliance` package family for privacy, security control mapping,
  data governance, audit, retention, AI governance, accessibility, deployment
  policy and compliance report contracts.
- Added `packages-logicn/logicn-core/docs/data-processing.md` plus the
  `logicn-data` package family for HTML, search, archive, JSON, database
  archive, streaming pipeline, memory-limit, security and data-processing
  report contracts.
- Expanded `packages-logicn/logicn-core/docs/data-processing.md` with typed
  database model, query, command, response and archive boundaries, and added
  `logicn-data-db`, `logicn-data-model`, `logicn-data-query`,
  `logicn-data-response` and initial `logicn-db-*` provider adapter scaffolds.
- Added `docs/APPLICATION_SECURITY_POSITIONING.md` to position LogicN's
  security advantage as application policy, deployment checks, package
  permissions, typed APIs, security reports and AI-safe context rather than a
  claim of stronger memory safety than Rust.
- Added `docs/NETWORK_ETHERNET_IO.md` and `packages-logicn/logicn-core-network/`
  to define LogicN network and Ethernet I/O positioning, deny-by-default
  network policy, TLS policy, backpressure, zero-copy planning, XDP/eBPF and
  DPDK adapter boundaries, deployment profiles and network reports.
- Expanded LogicN safe-networking policy to clarify that packets cannot be made
  invisible, while packet contents should be encrypted, authenticated,
  permissioned, minimised and auditable with TLS 1.3 policy, mTLS, service
  identity, plaintext fallback denial and secret-safe URL handling.
- Added `logicn-core-logic` Tri helpers, explicit Tri-to-Bool conversion policy,
  LogicN definition validation, truth-table validation and contract tests.
- Added an initial `logicn-core-compiler` core syntax safety scan for unsafe
  Tri/Decision/Bool conversions, non-exhaustive Tri matches, risky secure-flow
  unknown handling, raw secret literals and unsafe dynamic execution patterns.
- Added `logicn-core-security` validation for redaction rules and permission models,
  including fail-closed malformed redaction handling, deny precedence and
  diagnostics for default-allow or wildcard-allow permissions.
- Added `logicn-core-config` host package manifest boundary validation so
  `package.json` remains NPM/host tooling and LogicN package graph fields stay in
  future `package-logicn.json`/`logicn.lock.json` manifests.
- Documented the completed move of LogicN packages from `packages/` to
  `packages-logicn/`, with `packages/` reserved for normal app/vendor package
  space.
- Added `docs/PACKAGE_NAMING.md` with naming prefix rules, staged rename
  candidates and future `logicn-io-*` package guidance.
- Documented the current workspace as a beta prototype rather than a stable
  release.
- Documented repository-maintained structure as authoritative over generated
  document suggestions, while allowing roadmap version labels to move.
- Added `logicn-devtools-*` and `logicn-tools-*` naming for development-only, staging,
  diagnostic and experimental packages that production applications should not
  download by default.
- Added `docs/PACKAGE_LAYOUT.md` for the proposed `package-logicn.json`,
  `logicn.lock.json`, `packages/` and `packages-logicn/` split.
- Added `docs/PROFILE_INSTALLERS.md` to define one LogicN language with
  profile-aware installer presets for web, server, agent, systems and future
  kernel project types.
- Added `docs/MULTI_AGENT_RUNTIME.md` and expanded `logicn-ai-agent` guidance
  with a zero-trust multi-agent runtime model covering typed messages,
  visibility scopes, tool gateways, secret guards, sandboxing, guarded memory
  and cache, human approval gates, loop protection and audit reports.
- Added `docs/DEPLOYMENT_AUTOCONFIG.md` and expanded `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` with
  deployment auto-configuration, target detection, runtime capability profiles,
  deployment gates, health/readiness/smoke tests, rollback metadata,
  architecture-aware compute selection and secret-safe deployment reports.
- Added `docs/PASSIVE_LLM_CACHE.md` and updated `logicn-ai`/report guidance with
  passive generic LLM and embedding cache policy, strict cache keys, typed
  output validation, privacy denials, provider-neutral stores, invalidation and
  secret-safe cache reports.
- Expanded `docs/why-controllers-not-used-in-LogicN.md` and route/API docs to
  define route contracts, typed actions/handlers, policies, effects and route
  reports as the secure API core, with controller-style grouping allowed only as
  optional framework sugar.
- Added `docs/DOMAIN_DRIVEN_DESIGN.md` to document optional thin DDD structure
  for business applications, including domain/flow/infrastructure/policy
  boundaries, pure-domain defaults, architecture reports and warnings against
  heavyweight layer-first DDD.
- Added `docs/FINANCE_PACKAGES.md` and `packages-logicn/logicn-finance-core/` as a grouped
  beta finance package area covering finance maths, market data, FIX, audit,
  risk, pricing and desktop interoperability boundaries.
- Added `packages-logicn/logicn-core/docs/logicn-vs-fsharp.md` to position LogicN honestly against
  F# as a beta, security-first, AI-readable and target-aware backend language
  concept rather than a production .NET competitor.

### Changed

- Renamed the generic `packages-logicn/app/` folder to
  `packages-logicn/logicn-framework-example-app/` so the package collection does not contain an
  ambiguous `app` package name.
- Updated workspace documentation and configuration to use `packages-logicn/logicn-core/`
  for the LogicN language package.
- Renamed the legacy language install script to `install-LogicN.sh`.
- Clarified that LogicN core is the language/compiler layer, while the Secure App
  Kernel is the optional runtime layer and full frameworks remain separate.
- Clarified that `logicn-framework-api-server` serves HTTP and delegates validation, auth and
  typed execution to `logicn-framework-app-kernel`.
- Documented the future split-repository layout where `packages-logicn/` can become
  its own reusable Git repository imported by multiple frameworks.
- Added simple `console.log("...")` output support to LogicN core checked Run Mode.
- Expanded `logicn-core-compute` target selection contracts with `low_bit_ai`,
  `cpu.generic`, AI inference workload planning and compute-auto selection
  reporting.
- Clarified that BitNet ternary model weights are separate from LogicN `Tri`
  semantics.
- Reworked low-bit AI target naming so LogicN source uses generic `low_bit_ai` and
  `ternary_ai` targets instead of backend-specific BitNet syntax.
- Completed initial `logicn-ai`, `logicn-ai-lowbit`, `logicn-target-cpu` and
  `logicn-cpu-kernels` contracts with validation helpers, examples and tests.
- Completed initial `logicn-core-compute` offload planning reports, low-bit AI fallback
  example and test coverage.
- Added a placeholder `LogicN graph` CLI command entry for future project graph
  generation and querying.
- Implemented the initial `LogicN graph` command to generate project graph JSON and
  a Markdown graph report from `logicn.workspace.json`.
- Clarified that project graph syntax and CLI commands are backend-neutral, with
  Graphify treated as an optional swappable backend rather than LogicN syntax.
- Expanded `logicn-devtools-project-graph` with a logicn-native workspace scanner that maps
  packages, documents, exported TypeScript contracts, package references and
  generated graph report outputs.
- Added graph query, explain and path helpers to `logicn-devtools-project-graph` and exposed
  them through `LogicN graph query`, `LogicN graph explain` and `LogicN graph path`.
- Updated workspace package mapping so `logicn-tools-benchmark` is tracked by the project
  graph and package registry.
- Added `optical_io` to compute, benchmark and photonic target planning
  contracts as an interconnect-aware data movement target.
- Added generic `ai_accelerator` planning support and an Intel Gaudi 3 backend
  profile to AI accelerator, compute and benchmark contracts.
- Narrowed the active workspace target list to `cpu` and `wasm`, with GPU, AI
  accelerator, photonic, optical I/O, low-bit AI and other advanced target work
  labelled post-v1 unless needed by core type-system semantics.
- Clarified that LogicN must not make measured speed claims over C#, Python, C or
  C++ until the compiler, memory model and benchmark methodology exist.
- Defined AI-readable as concrete syntax/tooling properties: regular grammar,
  explicit effects/imports, typed errors, source maps, stable diagnostics and
  machine-readable reports.

### Removed

- Removed stale generated-output-only duplicate package folders
  `packages-logicn/logicn-cli/`, `packages-logicn/logicn-compute/` and
  `packages-logicn/logicn-config/` after confirming the canonical `logicn-core-*` packages
  contain the current source, tests, manifests and newer contracts.
- Moved `packages-logicn/logicn-finance-core/`, `packages-logicn/logicn-electrical-core/` and
  `packages-logicn/logicn-ot-core/` to `C:\laragon\www\LogicN_Archive\packages-logicn\` and
  removed them from active workspace package resolution.

### Fixed

- Nothing yet.
