# Requirements

## Scope

This repository is a LogicN application template and package workspace. It does not
yet define one specific product domain. Requirements in this file describe what
the template, package boundaries and developer tooling must provide so a
bespoke application can be built on top of LogicN safely.

Product-specific requirements belong in this file once an app domain is chosen.
Until then, `packages-logicn/logicn-framework-example-app/` remains a minimal app area and feature placeholders
must not be treated as implemented app functionality.

## Template Goals

- Provide a clear workspace for LogicN language, compiler/runtime contracts,
  security primitives, tooling packages and bespoke app code.
- Keep language documentation in `packages-logicn/logicn-core/` and app/workspace
  documentation in `docs/`.
- Support CPU-compatible checked execution and deterministic reports as the
  practical baseline.
- Keep v1 focused on `logicn serve` and the secure web runtime.
  CPU-compatible checked execution remains the baseline, with a simple portable
  build target as a secondary v1 milestone. WASM, GPU, photonic, low-bit AI,
  AI accelerator, optical I/O and native executable support remain target
  planning unless needed to explain core type-system semantics.
- Support neural-network workloads through typed packages and target planning,
  not by making neural networks part of normal app syntax.
- Support parallel AI agents only as supervised, bounded, permissioned,
  cancelable and reportable workloads.
- Support LogicN Structured Await as the normal concurrency model: synchronous-looking
  waits with scoped child work, typed effects, timeouts, cancellation and reports
  instead of exposed future/promise plumbing.
- Support controlled recovery for batch/data flows while stopping safely on
  unsafe system or runtime integrity failures.
- Support safe application crash handling through typed errors, controlled
  panic/crash categories, app-kernel crash boundaries, structured crash reports,
  safe logging, health checks and supervised worker restart policy.
- Support storage-aware performance planning without claiming direct support for
  SSD, NVMe, M.2 or other hardware. Storage detection must be optional,
  reportable and safe when unknown.
- Give AI coding tools enough generated context to understand package ownership
  without replacing compiler, runtime, security or test checks.
- Provide safe task automation with explicit effects, permissions and reports.
- Support a future Learning Mode for students, children, teachers and beginners
  through safe examples, guided diagnostics, sandboxed execution, hints,
  teacher reports and child-safe privacy defaults.

## V1 Language Requirements

- The v1 surface must freeze around core syntax, the core type system,
  `Result<T, E>`, `Option<T>`, the memory-safety model, `logicn serve`, secure
  web runtime policy and CPU-compatible checked execution.
- Everything beyond secure runtime execution and the simple portable build
  target must be labelled post-v1 or target planning unless it is necessary to
  define the core type system.
- LogicN must not make measured performance claims until the compiler, memory
  model, runtime and benchmark methodology exist. Current performance wording
  must be framed as a goal or opportunity, not a measured fact.
- LogicN benchmarks must separate validation from speed ranking. Fixed-operation
  mode validates matching checksums; timed 10-30 second throughput mode provides
  the official median operations-per-second score. Warm-up must use throwaway
  state and must not mutate the measured benchmark state.
- LogicN startup must prefer verified boot profiles over runtime discovery in
  production. Expensive route, policy, schema, package and target planning
  should happen at build/check time; boot should verify hashes, load the
  smallest safe runtime surface and defer optional packages until after
  readiness.
- LogicN fast response planning must combine verified boot profiles,
  precompiled route dispatch, prebuilt validators, warmed policy tables,
  bounded pools, safe inbound connection reuse and safe outbound connection
  pooling. Keep-alive policy must never bypass auth, validation, TLS, rate
  limits, body limits, backpressure or secret-safe logging.
- LogicN v1 concept documentation must keep the five-part model as the main
  teaching structure while indexing detailed concepts underneath it: routes,
  requests, responses/views, secure flows, models, contracts, policies,
  effects, capabilities, classification, context, scopes/lifetimes, errors,
  reports, packages and tests.
- LogicN match catch-all branches using `_ => { ... }` must be documented as
  explicit fallback handling. For security-sensitive matches, catch-all branches
  must return a typed error, explicit ignored response, safe log, manual review
  or fail-closed result instead of silently swallowing unknown states.
- LogicN must not claim production language maturity until it has an enforceable
  language core: parser, AST, symbol table, type checker, memory checker, effect
  checker, module system, protocols/interfaces, trusted interop boundary, test
  model, standard library, source-mapped runtime errors and build/release modes.
- LogicN security positioning must be framed as a secure web runtime goal:
  stronger default policy for permissions, APIs, memory-safe values, secrets,
  package effects, interop, deployment and AI-readable reports.
- LogicN's first product target is secure web-application runtime code:
  APIs, webhooks, service workers, queue workers, typed JSON services,
  auth-heavy applications and agent/tool gateway backends. Low-level systems
  targets, embedded targets and native executable output remain later target
  paths.
- LogicN must keep normal source high-level while still allowing local machine
  setup to specialise runtime plans. The Machine Profile Bridge must sit between
  checked LogicN source and machine-specific execution, detect local
  capabilities, cache uncommitted local profiles, configure boot/main runtime
  settings for the deployment machine and report every adapter, fallback and
  permission decision.
- Low-level boundary syntax must use `layout native` and `interop native` as
  the official draft wording. Native blocks must declare a concrete ABI such as
  `abi c`, `abi wasm`, `abi system` or `abi plugin`; the ABI must drive layout,
  ownership, nullability, allocator and audit checks.
- LogicN must treat data and behavior as untrusted by default within reason.
  External input, dependency output, generated AI content, cached data, network
  data, database data, uploaded files, environment-derived values, headers,
  cookies, tokens, runtime metadata and build artifacts must earn trust through
  validation, typing, provenance, policy checks or explicit reviewed
  boundaries.
- LogicN syntax itself must be treated as untrusted until governed. A parser
  accepting a feature must not make that feature production-ready; each syntax
  surface must be typed, effect-checked, permissioned, bounded, source-mapped,
  tested or reportable before it is treated as safe.
- LogicN must ban monkey patching in normal code. Runtime mutation of built-ins,
  imported modules, package internals, framework methods, response serializers,
  security policies or provider functions must be denied by default. Use
  adapters, interfaces/protocols, pipelines, test-only mocks or signed hotfix
  packages instead.
- Trust transitions must be represented in types, policies or reports. A value
  must not silently move from untrusted to trusted because it crossed an
  internal function boundary.
- LogicN must not claim to make Ethernet hardware faster. Network positioning
  must be framed as improving application network I/O through typed APIs,
  deny-by-default network permissions, TLS policy, backpressure, timeout policy,
  zero-copy planning, platform-aware I/O backend selection, reports and
  deployment profiles.
- Memory safety must be tied to an explicit mechanism. The current candidate is
  hybrid ownership: immutable sharing by default, one active mutable owner,
  read-only and mutable borrows, explicit moves for resources, bounds-checked
  collections and no raw pointers in normal application code.
- LogicN must not claim direct control over L1/L2/L3 CPU cache or ECC memory.
  Cache behaviour must be framed as optimisation through layout, access pattern,
  batching, copying and vectorisation guidance. ECC must be framed as a
  deployment reliability property that can only be detected or required when
  the platform exposes trustworthy evidence.
- LogicN syntax should stay readable and examples should be easy to follow,
  while types, missing values, errors, effects, package authority, dynamic
  execution, imports, JSON decoding, native interop and secret output remain
  explicit, checked and reportable.
- Future cache-aware memory work should support contiguous arrays, fixed-size
  buffers, read-only views, copy-on-write for large values, explicit clone
  warnings, hot/cold data separation, structure-of-arrays layouts,
  array-of-structures layouts, false-sharing warnings, hot-loop analysis and
  memory/cache reports.
- Future ECC-aware reliability policy may require ECC-capable environments for
  high-integrity workloads, but it must fail closed or warn when ECC status is
  unknown. Reports may include ECC detected/unknown status and corrected or
  uncorrected error counts only when exposed by the OS, firmware, hardware or
  runtime environment.
- LogicN must define deterministic cleanup for explicit resources such as files,
  sockets, locks, GPU buffers, model handles, DB connections, streams and
  temporary secrets.
- `.env` values must be treated as secrets, not normal strings. Secret values
  must be declared, typed, scoped, redacted, tracked through secret-derived
  values and denied from logs, errors, caches, LLM inputs, build output and
  reports unless an explicit safe sink policy allows metadata or controlled use.
- Environment secrets must use a protected form such as `Secret<T>` or a
  secret reference. They must not silently become `String` values, be converted
  with `toString()`, escape `with secret` lifetime blocks or be returned from
  normal functions.
- Secret reports may include names, required flags, scopes, allowed operations,
  allowed destinations and fingerprints, but must never include secret values.
- LogicN must define traits, protocols or generic constraints before building a
  large reusable library ecosystem.
- Recoverable errors must be explicit in syntax and types through
  `Result<T, E>` or an equivalent typed result form. Hidden exceptions must not
  be the default application error model.
- Expected application errors, external failures and unexpected runtime crashes
  must be distinguishable in types, policies or reports.
- Public routes, webhooks, scheduled tasks and workers must have a crash
  boundary directly or through an app-level default when they can write data,
  call external systems, process payments or perform other state-changing work.
- Crash reports must be structured, source-mapped where possible, secret-safe,
  request/job correlated and safe for operators or AI tools to inspect.
- Runtime crash reports must not include raw secrets, cookies, authorization
  headers, payment credentials, private customer data or unredacted payloads.
- Workers and scheduled tasks must support supervised restart policy, bounded
  retries, backoff and crash-loop detection.
- LogicN may support `try`/`catch` as readable syntax over explicit
  `Result<T, E>` flow, but `match` must remain available for branch-by-branch
  handling where every outcome matters.
- `Result<T, E>` must be documented as `Result<SuccessType, ErrorType>` for
  learners and API authors.
- Missing values must use `Option<T>` or another explicit typed missing-value
  form, not unchecked null.
- `Tri` must not silently convert to `Bool`. Branch conditions must require
  `Bool`; `Tri` values must use exhaustive `match` or an explicit conversion
  policy such as `unknown_as: false`, `unknown_as: error` or equivalent.
- AI-readable must mean concrete compiler/tooling properties: regular grammar,
  explicit effects, explicit imports, typed errors, source maps, stable
  diagnostics and machine-readable reports. It must not be a vague marketing
  label.
- LogicN must not claim legal, privacy, security, accessibility, AI governance
  or deployment compliance automatically. Compliance packages may define
  policy, evidence, review and report contracts, but compliance depends on
  jurisdiction, organisation process, deployment controls and human review.
- LogicN data processing must be package-owned and bounded. HTML parsing,
  search indexing, archive manifests, JSON/database archiving and streaming
  pipelines must live in `logicn-data-*` packages rather than becoming native
  core-language features.
- LogicN database access must be typed, validated, permissioned and reportable.
  Database storage models must be distinct from API response models, and raw
  database models containing personal, secret, hidden or internal fields must
  not be returned by public routes.
- Before adding more active packages, the project must include at least 20 real
  `.lln` example programs covering basic, intermediate and advanced syntax.
  This requirement is currently satisfied by the 20 source fixtures in
  `packages-logicn/logicn-core/examples/`.

## Core Workspace Requirements

- The root README must introduce LogicN, the workspace layout, current tooling and
  package boundaries.
- `AGENTS.md` must tell AI tools how to use the project graph and where package
  responsibilities live.
- `logicn.workspace.json` must identify the package paths and documentation roots
  used by tooling.
- Generated project graph outputs must be refreshable from the repository root.
- The workspace must keep generated compiler output out of Git unless a file is
  intentionally committed as an example or report artefact.
- Active core packages must provide typed contract exports and focused tests
  before downstream framework or target packages depend on them. The current
  core package baseline covers network policy/TLS/backend reports, runtime
  context/results/effects/reports, vector/matrix/tensor validation and bounded
  photonic planning contracts.
- Core package examples must be validated by package tests when they are used
  as contract examples rather than prose-only documentation.
- `logicn-core-cli` must route core developer commands to the current
  `logicn-core` prototype compiler until those commands have native package
  implementations.
- NPU support must be treated as AI inference target planning, not as
  general-purpose LogicN execution. Model files remain external, fallback must
  be explicit and reportable, and on-device inference must deny network
  execution unless policy explicitly changes that boundary.
- The workspace must keep secrets out of source control.
- Package READMEs and TODOs must describe package responsibility and remaining
  implementation work.
- This workspace is a beta prototype, not a stable release. Version metadata
  must use beta prerelease identifiers until release criteria are explicitly
  met.
- The future LogicN package split should be documented before implementation:
  `package.json` for normal app/vendor packages, `package-logicn.json` for LogicN
  package dependencies, `logicn.lock.json` for locked LogicN package graphs,
  `packages/` for normal vendor packages and `packages-logicn/` for LogicN packages.
- NPM and `package.json` must remain host ecosystem tooling only. They may run
  current JavaScript/TypeScript prototype checks and package generated JS/TS
  interop, but they must not define LogicN package graph resolution, LogicN runtime
  profiles, LogicN compiler target policy or LogicN production package overrides.
- Generated documents and AI-suggested structures are advisory. Repository
  package boundaries, `AGENTS.md`, `logicn.workspace.json`, package READMEs/TODOs
  and maintained docs take precedence when suggestions conflict.
- Learning Mode must teach real LogicN concepts rather than fake syntax. It may
  provide progressive levels, guided exercises, hints and beginner-friendly
  diagnostics, but examples must remain aligned with documented LogicN syntax.
- Learning Mode execution must be safe by default: no shell, no secrets, no
  filesystem writes, no external network, bounded memory and bounded runtime
  unless a lesson explicitly grants a reviewed permission.
- Learning Mode for children must avoid real-money examples, production deploys,
  personal-data collection, open chat, unsafe links and public sharing by
  default.
- Learning reports must avoid secret values, unnecessary personal data, raw
  student identifiers in shareable reports and private messages.
- Future `logicn-learn*` package names are reserved planning names only. Do not
  add active learning packages until the core examples, parser/checker and
  lesson model are stable enough to justify package ownership.

## App Requirements

The app package must remain deliberately small until a product domain is chosen.

- Bespoke app source must live in `packages-logicn/logicn-framework-example-app/`.
- App routes, modules, tests and app configuration must stay in `packages-logicn/logicn-framework-example-app/`
  or app-specific docs.
- App-specific requirements must be added to this document before implementing
  product features.
- App source must use explicit validation, explicit error handling and safe
  configuration references.
- App features must not be implemented inside `packages-logicn/logicn-core/`.
- App features must not turn `packages-logicn/logicn-framework-app-kernel/` into a full framework,
  CMS, admin dashboard, ORM or frontend framework.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- The template must be secure by default.
- The template must validate external input at typed boundaries.
- Errors must be explicit and safely reportable.
- Application effects must be deny-by-default. File, network, database, shell,
  AI, GPU and interop access must be declared before use.
- Network access must be denied by default. Inbound ports, outbound hosts, raw
  sockets, packet capture, promiscuous mode, shell network tools and wildcard
  network access must require explicit policy and report output.
- Production networked apps must require TLS policy, request/body size limits,
  route-level rate limits, timeout policy and stream backpressure for public
  routes unless an explicit reviewed override exists.
- Cookie-authenticated browser routes that change state must require CSRF
  protection by default.
- CSRF protection must support synchronizer tokens for stateful apps, signed
  double-submit cookies for stateless apps, custom CSRF headers for SPA/API
  clients, Fetch Metadata validation, Origin/Referer validation, SameSite cookie
  defaults and route-level CSRF reports.
- Routes using `GET`, `HEAD` or `OPTIONS` must not perform state-changing
  handler effects such as write, delete, payment, trade, password change, email
  change, account deletion, file upload or admin actions.
- Routes using bearer-token or other explicit non-cookie authorization may
  declare CSRF not required, but must still enforce CORS policy where relevant,
  Origin checks where useful, rate limits, request validation and audit logging.
- CSRF reports must not include CSRF token values, session identifiers, cookies,
  authorization headers or other secret-bearing values.
- Production networked apps must deny plaintext fallback, silent TLS downgrade,
  disabled certificate validation, disabled hostname validation, weak ciphers,
  expired certificates, debug proxying and secrets in URLs.
- Enterprise service-call policy must support mutual TLS, service identity,
  host allowlists and package-level network permissions.
- Sensitive payload policy must support application-layer encryption and
  metadata minimisation where transport encryption alone is not enough.
- API handlers must receive typed, validated request values by default; unknown
  fields, oversized JSON and invalid payload shapes must be rejected at the
  boundary.
- Routes must compile into a typed route graph and route manifest rather than
  remaining loose runtime strings. Route manifests must include HTTP method,
  typed path parameters, request body type, response type, auth policy,
  authorization policy, CSRF/CORS policy where relevant, rate limits, timeout,
  maximum body size, concurrency limits, declared effects, response filtering
  and audit policy.
- Route matching should use a method-indexed precompiled trie/radix-tree or
  equivalent lookup structure so runtime routing does not scan long route lists
  or build regexes on the hot path.
- State-changing routes must not compile unless auth, CSRF or an explicit
  non-cookie auth exemption, idempotency where risky, audit policy and resource
  limits are declared.
- Routes using user-supplied object identifiers must declare object-level
  authorization. Routes returning sensitive response schemas must declare or
  inherit property-level response filtering.
- Route handlers must not perform effects outside the route's declared
  database, network, file, AI, cache, secret or shell permissions.
- API route contracts should declare allowed HTTP responses by status and body
  schema, and handlers/actions must not return undeclared statuses or body
  schemas.
- HTTP responses must be typed security contracts. Each response must declare
  status code, body type, content type, cache policy, security header profile,
  cookie policy where relevant, redirect policy where relevant, field filtering
  policy and safe error exposure policy.
- Raw HTTP responses and mutable raw header maps must be denied by default
  except inside trusted low-level transport packages.
- Private/authenticated routes must not use public cache. HTML responses must
  require a CSP/security-header profile. JSON responses must declare JSON
  content type and `nosniff`. Redirects must target trusted routes or validated
  allowlisted destinations.
- API response helper naming should avoid confusing pairs such as `Response`
  and `Responses`. Prefer a clear split such as `Http` for framework HTTP
  response builders and `AppResponses` for app response body schemas.
- API response checking should report unhandled `Result` values,
  non-exhaustive known error matches, route responses returned but not declared,
  declared responses that cannot be returned and unsafe raw error messages sent
  to users.
- LogicN must not require traditional MVC controllers as a core application
  concept. The secure API core must be route contracts, typed request/response
  objects, route actions or handlers, policies, effects and generated route
  reports.
- Controller-style grouping may be supported later only as optional framework
  sugar that compiles into the same route manifest/graph and does not hide auth,
  CSRF, object access, idempotency, validation, rate limits, audit or effects.
- LogicN may support optional thin DDD structure for business applications, but
  DDD must not be required for small apps, scripts or early compiler examples.
- Thin DDD guidance must keep business rules in `domain/`, use cases in
  `flows/`, external systems in `infrastructure/`, routes in `api/`, runtime
  and security controls in `policies/`, and reports in `reports/` where that
  structure adds clarity.
- Domain code should be pure by default and must not secretly perform database,
  network, file, secret, cache or LLM effects.
- DDD must not be treated as the security model, memory model or compute
  performance model. Security must come from LogicN policies and checks, memory
  safety from LogicN memory rules, and speed from compute policies, profiling,
  caching and target reports.
- Architecture reports may warn about excessive layers, empty wrappers,
  database-shaped domains, unused abstractions, business rules inside API files
  and infrastructure effects inside domain code.
- Raw SQL, unsafe interop, raw shell execution and untrusted deserialization
  must be denied by default in production policy.
- Security reports must include risky permissions, package effects, route
  policy gaps, secret-flow risks, interop adapters and production overrides.
- CLI and task output must redact secrets, bearer tokens, cookies, private keys
  and `SecureString` values.
- Runtime configuration must stay separate from compiled output.
- Build and report artefacts must identify selected targets and fallback
  reasons where relevant.
- Documentation must be updated when architecture, requirements, security, API,
  deployment or package behavior changes.

  live in `packages-logicn/logicn-core-compute/`.
- Generic AI inference contracts, model metadata, safety policy and AI reports
  must live in `packages-logicn/logicn-ai/`.
- Low-bit and ternary AI inference contracts must live in
  `packages-logicn/logicn-ai-lowbit/`, with BitNet represented only as a backend.
- Supervised AI agent definitions, tool permissions, task groups, merge
  policies and reports must live in `packages-logicn/logicn-ai-agent/`.
- Neural-network model, layer, inference and training boundary contracts must
  live in `packages-logicn/logicn-ai-neural/`.

  `packages-logicn/logicn-ai-neuromorphic/`.
- Photonic and wavelength hardware concepts must live in
  `packages-logicn/logicn-core-photonic/`.
- CPU target planning, feature detection and fallback reports must live in
  `packages-logicn/logicn-target-cpu/`.
- Optimized CPU kernel contracts must live in `packages-logicn/logicn-cpu-kernels/`.
- Native executable target planning must live in `packages-logicn/logicn-target-native/`.
- Portable systems output planning may start in
  `packages-logicn/logicn-target-native/` only after ABI, layout and memory
  report rules stabilise.
- LogicN must treat systems output as a generated backend/interop target, not
  as normal unsafe application source style.
- Future native ABI work must declare ownership, nullability, string encoding,
  allocator/free policy, blocking/thread-safety assumptions and error mapping.
- JavaScript target planning must live in `packages-logicn/logicn-target-js/`.
- WebAssembly target planning must live in `packages-logicn/logicn-target-wasm/`.
- GPU target planning must live in `packages-logicn/logicn-target-gpu/`.
- AI accelerator target planning for NPU, TPU and AI-chip backends must live in

- Photonic backend target planning must live in
  `packages-logicn/logicn-target-photonic/`.
- The optional LogicN Secure App Kernel must live in `packages-logicn/logicn-framework-app-kernel/`.
- The built-in LogicN HTTP API server must live in `packages-logicn/logicn-framework-api-server/`.
- Server platform support must distinguish deployment targets, runtime targets
  and adapters. Nginx, Apache and Caddy must be treated as reverse-proxy
  deployment targets; Node.js may be a tooling platform and optional runtime
  target; Express/Fastify/Hono-style integrations must be optional adapters;
  the LogicN-native API server remains the long-term preferred secure runtime.
- Browser-safe web rendering contracts must live in `packages-logicn/logicn-web/`
  and focused `logicn-web-*` packages, not in `logicn-core`, the app kernel or
  the API server.
- The LogicN developer CLI must live in `packages-logicn/logicn-core-cli/`.
- Safe LogicN project automation must live in `packages-logicn/logicn-core-tasks/`.
- LogicN benchmark and diagnostics tooling must live in `packages-logicn/logicn-tools-benchmark/`.
- LogicN project knowledge graph tooling must live in `packages-logicn/logicn-devtools-project-graph/`.
- Bespoke app source must live in `packages-logicn/logicn-framework-example-app/`.
- App documentation must live in `docs/`.
- Language documentation must stay within `packages-logicn/logicn-core/`.
- Full framework features must stay outside `packages-logicn/logicn-core/` and
  `packages-logicn/logicn-framework-app-kernel/`.
- Current development may use one root Git repository while package boundaries
  are still being shaped.
- Later, `packages-logicn/` may become its own Git repository so the LogicN packages can be
  imported into different frameworks.
- If `packages-logicn/` has its own `.git`, it must be added intentionally as a
  submodule or standalone nested repository, and the framework root must treat
  it as an external dependency.
- Development-only packages must use `logicn-devtools-*` or `logicn-tools-*` names for
  staging packages, diagnostics, generators and experiments.
- Development-only packages must be excluded from production package resolution
  and production downloads unless a maintainer explicitly opts into a
  development or staging profile.
- Production boot/profile defaults must disable development-only and benchmark
  packages such as `logicn-devtools-*` and `logicn-tools-benchmark`.
- A production build that includes a default-disabled package must declare an
  explicit production package override with a reason, and the override must be
  visible in config/build/security/deployment reports. Without that override,
  startup or build validation must fail.
- The exact developer package folder name remains provisional, but its boundary
  must stay separate from production runtime package manifests.
- Finance, electrical and OT package planning must stay archived outside the
  active workspace under `C:\laragon\www\LogicN_Archive\packages-logicn\` until post-v2
  package planning resumes.
- Finance, electrical and OT packages must not be part of active v1 package
  resolution, build graph generation, compiler targets or runtime profiles.
- Any future restoration of finance, electrical or OT packages must require a
  design review because these domains carry regulatory, protocol correctness,
  safety and cybersecurity requirements beyond the v1 language scope.
- Package naming must follow `docs/PACKAGE_NAMING.md`: `logicn-target-*` for where
  code runs or compiles to, `logicn-io-*` for how data moves, `logicn-ai-*` for
  AI-specific workloads, `logicn-kernel-*` for low-level execution kernels and
  `logicn-app-*` for runtime/application framework layers.
- `logicn-target-native` and `logicn-target-photonic` must not be renamed to I/O
  package names; binary and photonic I/O should be added later as separate
  `logicn-io-*` packages.

## Archived Electrical and OT Package Requirements

These requirements are preserved as post-v2 archive notes. They do not apply to
the active v1 build graph.

- `logicn-electrical-core` must be a domain package group, not core LogicN syntax.
- `logicn-ot-core` must be an operational-technology integration package group, not
  core LogicN syntax and not a SCADA, PLC or safety controller product.
- LogicN electrical support must be positioned as modelling, validation,
  monitoring, workflow and audit support. It must not replace circuit breakers,
  relays, protective devices, PLC safety systems, grid protection, certified
  controllers or qualified electrical design.
- Early electrical contracts must start with asset models, telemetry ingestion,
  alerts, reports, capacity checks, maintenance schedules, energy reports, OT
  network policy and protection setting record/audit evidence.
- Early electrical contracts must avoid direct breaker control, relay protection
  replacement, PLC replacement, safety interlock control, unsupervised
  switching and real-time grid control.
- Electrical asset models may cover panels, circuits, breakers, cables, loads,
  meters, transformers, inverters, batteries, EV chargers, UPS, generators,
  relays and sensors.
- Electrical telemetry may cover voltage, current, power, power factor,
  frequency, phase imbalance, harmonics, temperature, breaker state, relay
  state, battery state of charge, solar generation, EV charger demand and UPS
  load.
- Electrical control policy must be deny-by-default. Reading telemetry,
  creating alerts and opening maintenance work orders are lower risk. Changing
  setpoints, switching load and breaker operations are high risk and must
  require explicit policy, approval, signed jobs, audit and suitable local
  safety interlocks.
- Protection setting support must manage records, versions, approvals, test
  evidence, rollback plans and compatibility reports. It must not replace
  protection relay behaviour.
- OT packages may define adapter boundaries for OPC UA, IEC 61850, Modbus, MQTT
  and SCADA connectors, but concrete protocol stacks and vendor integrations
  should remain package-specific and permissioned.
- OT security must require read-only defaults, network segmentation, host
  allowlists, signed commands, operator approval, mTLS where appropriate, no
  arbitrary scripts, no undeclared package network access and audit of all
  control attempts.
- Electrical and OT reports must avoid raw secrets, unnecessary personal data
  and unsafe control payloads.

## Archived Finance Package Requirements

These requirements are preserved as post-v2 archive notes. They do not apply to
the active v1 build graph.

- `logicn-finance-core` must be a domain package group, not core LogicN syntax.
- Finance support must start with typed data, deterministic maths, validation,
  audit, replay and integration contracts rather than live trading systems.
- Finance maths must disallow float money by default, require explicit rounding
  mode and make rounding decisions reportable.
- Market-data contracts must model instruments, exchanges, sessions, quotes,
  trades, order book levels, candles, snapshots, source metadata and replayable
  event streams.
- FIX support must be defined as an integration package boundary for message
  dictionaries, validation, session state, sequence numbers, heartbeats, resend
  requests, rejects, execution reports, order cancel/replace and persistence
  policy.
- Finance audit must support immutable event references, message hashes, order
  lifecycle reconstruction, risk decision reports, permission decision reports
  and redacted evidence bundles.
- Risk and pricing package work must wait until finance maths, market data and
  audit contracts are stable enough to support them.
- LogicN finance packages may wrap mature external finance ecosystems through
  controlled interop, but wrappers must declare memory
  isolation, credential policy, network permissions, audit requirements and
  fallback behaviour.
- Early LogicN finance work must not claim to implement a full stock exchange,
  HFT engine, broker-dealer platform, settlement system, clearing system,
  custody platform or regulated trading-advice engine.

## Secure App Kernel Requirements

- The kernel may define typed API boundaries, validation, auth policy,

  generated from route manifests where available, such as method-indexed
  tries/radix trees, and must reject unknown methods/paths early.

  `logicn-framework-app-kernel`.
- `logicn-framework-api-server` must enforce server-level limits such as body size, timeout,
  connection shutdown and safe response writing.

  values and private key material from output and reports.

## Benchmark Requirements

- `logicn-tools-benchmark` must own benchmark configuration, task definitions, result
  types, score categories, privacy policy and report payload contracts.
- Benchmarking must prioritize correctness, fallback behavior and safe
  execution before raw speed.
- Light mode must be the default and must be bounded by total runtime, per-test
  runtime and safe memory limits.
- Full and stress modes must be explicit opt-in modes and must not run
  automatically.
- Benchmark runs must be manual, CI-explicit or development-only major-version

  variables, secrets, private repo names and raw benchmark input data.
- Future benchmark sharing must be opt-in and must prepare an anonymous payload
  by default.
- Hash and byte-processing tests must be framed as generated-data throughput,
  checksum or validation tests, not password cracking, token guessing or
  malicious brute forcing.

  it must not replace compiler checks, runtime policy enforcement or security
  reports.

- Project graph syntax and CLI commands must stay backend-neutral; `LogicN graph`
  must not become `LogicN graphify`.
- Graphify or any future graph tool must be represented as a swappable backend
  selected by policy, not as LogicN language syntax.
- Git-sourced project graph backends must be explicitly allowed and pinned to a
  commit, tag or versioned ref.
- Model-assisted extraction for documents, PDFs, images, audio or video must be
  opt-in and reported.
- Project graph outputs should include JSON, human-readable report and AI map
  paths so assistants can query project relationships without rereading every
  file.
- The native project graph mapper should map workspace packages, package docs,
  exported TypeScript contracts, package metadata, project docs and generated
  graph report outputs.

## Logic and Photonic Package Requirements

- `logicn-core-logic` must own `Tri`, `LogicN`, future Omni logic, multi-state truth
  tables, conversion rules and logic reports.
- `logicn-core-logic` must validate declared logic widths, state names, state
  indexes and truth-table coverage so malformed or incomplete logic definitions

  memory-limit, archive-integrity and report index contracts.
- `logicn-data-*` packages must own focused contracts for HTML processing,
  search, archive integrity, JSON archive, database export/archive, streaming

  unbounded scraping frameworks.
- `logicn-data-db`, `logicn-data-model`, `logicn-data-query` and
  `logicn-data-response` must own typed database boundary, storage model,
  query/command and safe response mapping contracts. Raw SQL must be denied by
  default unless an explicit reviewed and reported override exists.
- `logicn-web` must own umbrella browser-safe web package policy and report
  indexes.

  partial-data states and state diff plans.
- `logicn-web-components`, `logicn-web-router` and `logicn-web-events` must own

  source-map rules, server-only import blocking, browser secret denial and
  JavaScript output reports.

  for server targets, but Node.js support must remain a target choice rather
  than the identity of LogicN.
- `logicn-target-cpu` must own CPU capability, feature, thread, memory and fallback
  planning contracts.
- `logicn-target-cpu` should own CPU cache fact detection contracts where
  available, including cache line size and exposed L1/L2/L3 metadata, while

  data movement reports.
- `logicn-target-ai-accelerator` must own NPU, TPU, AI-chip capability reports,
  precision support, model operation mapping plans and accelerator fallback
  reports.
- AI accelerator support must be passive and vendor-neutral. LogicN source syntax
  should use `ai_accelerator`, not vendor-specific targets such as `gaudi`.
- Vendor devices such as Intel Gaudi 3 must be represented as backend profiles
  selected by config, adapter policy or capability detection.
- AI accelerator profiles must report preferred workloads, supported
  precisions, memory tiers, framework adapters, topology, fallback target and
  warnings.
- Intel Gaudi 3 should be documented as an AI accelerator profile for LLM
  inference, fine-tuning, RAG, embeddings, multimodal AI and tensor batching,
  not as a normal CPU or GPU.
- First AI accelerator implementations should prefer controlled adapters over
  existing ecosystems such as PyTorch, vLLM, Hugging Face, DeepSpeed,
  TensorFlow or PyTorch Lightning before native backend work.
- `logicn-target-photonic` must own photonic backend target planning and may use
  `logicn-core-photonic` concepts.
- `optical_io` must be treated as a high-speed data-movement and interconnect
  target, not as a normal CPU, GPU or photonic compute target.

  must be represented as a deployment capability for topology-aware,
  encrypted, typed data movement across optical-capable infrastructure.
- Optical I/O target planning must distinguish Ethernet, Wi-Fi, fibre, RDMA,
  RoCE, optical I/O, co-packaged optics and photonic interconnect capabilities.
- Intel Silicon Photonics and OCI-style devices must be documented as optical
  connectivity for distributed compute, AI infrastructure, accelerator
  communication, GPU disaggregation and memory pooling.
- `logicn-core-compute` must model data movement as a first-class cost for optical I/O
  planning, including transfer size, data locality, target placement, fallback
  path, serialization format, compression choice, encryption overhead and
  accelerator locality.
- Optical I/O reports must include detected interconnect, provider, bandwidth
  estimate, latency estimate, fallback path, largest transfers, compression or
  binary format use, remote memory status, topology redaction status,
  energy estimate where available and security/encryption policy.
- Optical I/O security policy must require encryption, endpoint identity,
  service identity, signed topology where available, no plaintext fallback,
  no unknown endpoint transfer, audit logging and redacted reports.
- Remote memory or memory-pool access over optical I/O must require typed access
  policy, bounds checks, timeout handling, fallback rules, audit logging and
  redacted reports.
- `logicn-tools-benchmark` should support a future `optical_io` benchmark target for
  latency, throughput, tensor transfer, schema-compressed transfer, encryption
  overhead, topology detection, remote memory read and fallback diagnostics.

## Compiler, Runtime, Security, Config and Report Requirements

- `logicn-core-compiler` must own compiler pipeline contracts for lexing, parsing, AST,
  checkers, IR, diagnostics, source maps and compiler reports.
- `logicn-core-compiler` must use the language-core maturity roadmap as a
  foundation checklist: real parser, AST, symbol table, type checker, memory
  checker, effect checker, IR, output, debug/release modes and source-mapped
  runtime errors.
- Until the full parser/checker exists, `logicn-core-compiler` must provide a
  conservative syntax safety scan for the frozen v1 core risks: direct Tri
  branch conditions, implicit Tri/Decision/Bool boundary assignments,
  non-exhaustive Tri matches, risky secure-flow unknown conversion, raw
  secret-like literals and unsafe dynamic execution forms.
- `logicn-core-runtime` must own execution contracts for checked and compiled LogicN code.
- `logicn-core-runtime` may collect runtime memory, cache and hardware
  reliability facts where the environment exposes them, but must report unknown
  status honestly for containers, VMs and managed platforms.
- `logicn-core-network` must own network I/O policy, profile, permission,
  backend capability and report contracts. It must not own HTTP framework
  behavior, TLS implementation, DNS resolver implementation, kernel driver code
  or DPDK runtime bindings.
- `logicn-core-network` must define safe-networking contracts for TLS 1.3
  policy, plaintext denial, certificate and hostname validation, mutual TLS,
  service identity, secret-safe URLs, metadata minimisation and packet-capture
  restrictions.
- `logicn-core-security` must own reusable security primitives, redaction rules,
  permission models, security diagnostics and security report contracts.
- `logicn-core-security` must support application-security positioning where
  LogicN is secure by default, typed by default, permissioned by default,
  reportable by default, deployment-aware by default and AI-safe by default.
- Security primitives must represent sensitive values as redacted references in
  reports and diagnostics, not as raw secret values.
- Security helpers must provide reusable redaction, safe token/cookie/header
  references, permission decisions and cryptographic policy validation.
- Security primitives must support `Secret<T>` or equivalent protected secret
  references, secret-derived taint tracking, secret fingerprint metadata,
  secret-safe sink decisions and fail-closed denial for logs, errors, cache,
  LLM input, build output and undeclared outbound destinations.
- Redaction helpers must fail closed by default when a rule is malformed, an
  input exceeds configured redaction limits or a replacement could re-emit the
  matched secret or surrounding context.
- Permission decisions must deny by default and must give matching deny grants
  precedence over matching allow grants. Default-allow and wildcard-allow
  models must be reportable diagnostics.
- `logicn-core-config` must own project config, environment mode and policy loading
  contracts.
- `logicn-core-config` must represent environment variables as safe references by name
  and metadata; it must not expose secret values in diagnostics or runtime
  handoff objects.
- `logicn-core-config` must provide production strictness checks for strict project mode,
  required environment variables and unsafe secret defaults.
- `logicn-core-config` must enforce production-disabled package defaults for
  development-only and benchmark packages, while supporting explicit reported
  production package overrides when policy allows them.
- `logicn-core-config` must validate the boundary between host package manifests
  and LogicN package manifests. LogicN package graph keys must not be accepted from
  `package.json`; they belong in `package-logicn.json`, `logicn.lock.json` or explicit
  LogicN config once those schemas exist.
- `logicn-core-reports` must own shared report schemas and report-writing contracts.
- Shared report contracts must include common metadata, generator metadata,
  diagnostic summaries and typed build, security, target, runtime, task and AI
  guide report shapes.
- Shared report contracts must include async/concurrency report shapes for
  Structured Await, including await sites, groups, missing timeout counts,
  unscoped task counts and structured-concurrency status.
- Shared report contracts should include storage and build-cache planning shapes
  for detected storage facts, unknown-storage fallback, conservative cache mode,
  cache hits, misses, bypasses, evictions and invalidations.
- Shared report contracts must include processing report shapes for resilient
  flows, partial success, retries, quarantined items and failure summaries.

## Storage-Aware Performance Requirements

- LogicN must not claim to support M.2, NVMe, SSDs or storage controllers directly.
  Operating systems, drivers, firmware and hardware controllers own physical
  storage access.
- LogicN may detect storage capability where available and use it to guide
  incremental compilation, IDE indexing, project graph scanning, large-file
  processing, JSON streaming, asset pipelines and diagnostics.
- Storage detection must degrade to `unknown` in containers, virtual machines,
  cloud volumes, network storage or restricted environments.
- Cache behavior must be conservative by default: bounded, rebuildable,
  content-addressed where practical, safe to bypass and safe to delete.
- Only deterministic, non-secret, rebuildable data may be cached automatically.
- LogicN must not automatically cache secrets, raw sensitive payloads, authorization
  decisions, non-deterministic results, database query results or external API
  responses.
- Application-level caching of database/API data must require explicit
  app/framework policy.
- Build and IDE caches must be invalidated by relevant source, config, package
  lock, tool version and policy changes.
- Large file and large JSON workflows should prefer streaming, bounded batches,
  read-only views and explicit clone/copy-on-write rules.
- Reports should show storage kind when known, unknown-storage fallback,
  recommended conservative cache mode, cache use, cache bypass and invalidation
  reasons.

## Structured Await Requirements

- LogicN must support `await` for effect-declared waits, but must not expose
  futures, promises, pinning, executors or manual polling as the normal
  application model.
- LogicN must support grouped waits through `await all`, race waits through
  `await race`, bounded stream processing through `await stream`, queue handoff
  through declared queue/job contracts and retry through explicit retry policy.
- Every task must belong to a scope. When a scope ends, unfinished child work
  must be cancelled, completed or handed off according to explicit policy.
- Pure functions must not use `await`.
- Awaiting external network or database work must require timeout policy in
  production profiles.
- Cancellation must be a normal declared policy, with modes such as
  `cancelOnError`, `waitForAll`, `firstSuccess`, `firstResult`,
  `timeoutCancel` and `manualCancel`.
- Hidden background work must be denied by default. Work that outlives a
  request must use a typed, reportable queue/job contract.
- Streams must declare bounded concurrency, backpressure policy and maximum
  in-flight work.
- Compiler diagnostics should warn when independent sequential awaits could use
  `await all`.
- Build and runtime reports should expose async behavior through deterministic
  async, await, concurrency, timeout and queue report entries.

## Resilient Flow Requirements

- `resilient flow` must mean controlled recovery, not silent error ignoring.
- Item-level failures may continue only when the flow declares an explicit
  recovery policy.
- System/runtime failures such as memory corruption, unsafe native failure or
  runtime integrity failure must stop the affected flow or restart safely under
  supervision.
- Recoverable item failures must be classified, recorded and reported.
- Retry must apply only to errors marked retryable.
- Quarantined items must be retained safely for review rather than discarded.
- Long-running resilient flows should support checkpoint and resume where safe.
- Security-sensitive workflows should fail fast or use transactions, rollback,
  idempotency and hold-for-review policy instead of continuing.
- Recovery reports must include total, success, failed, retried, quarantined,
  stopped and failure-type summary fields.

## AI and Low-Bit Backend Requirements

- AI inference must be target-neutral at the `logicn-ai` layer.
- AI agents must declare input type, output type, tools, effects, permissions,
  memory budget, timeout, rate limits and failure behaviour.
- Parallel agents must run inside supervised task groups, queues, worker pools
  or equivalent runtime supervision.
- AI agents must be treated as untrusted workers by default.
- AI agents must not directly access files, `.env`, raw secrets, databases,
  network, terminal, Git, other agents, deployment tools or LLM memory.
- AI agents must use typed message passing through a runtime-controlled message
  bus rather than direct agent-to-agent communication.
- Agent visibility scopes must limit which files, reports and context an agent
  can see, and must exclude `.env`, secret files, private logs and raw
  production data by default.
- Agent tool use must go through a tool gateway with explicit allow and deny
  rules for commands, arguments, files, environment and result redaction.
- Agents must normally propose file changes, dependency installs, migrations and
  deployments rather than applying them directly.
- Human approval must be required by default for file writes, dependency
  installs, database migrations, production deploys, secret creation/rotation,
  bulk email, payment actions and permission changes.
- Agent memory and passive LLM cache must deny secrets, raw personal data,
  authorization headers, cookies and environment values by default.
- Multi-agent runtimes must enforce max steps, max agent calls, max retries,
  max runtime and loop detection.
- Every multi-agent run must produce an audit report covering agents used,
  tools used, files read or proposed for change, cache decisions, policy
  violations, secrets access decisions and human approval requirements.
- Agent outputs may inform decisions but must not directly authorize security,
  payment, access-control or deployment decisions.
- Neural-network support must live in `logicn-ai-neural`, not `logicn-core`.
- Neural workloads must use tensor shapes from `logicn-core-vector`, compute planning
  from `logicn-core-compute` and safety/report contracts from `logicn-ai`.
- Training flows must declare dataset reference, data policy, loss function,
  optimizer, epochs, batch size, memory limit and timeout.
- Neuromorphic support must live in `logicn-ai-neuromorphic`, separate from normal
  tensor neural networks.
- Low-bit AI support must be optional and must not be required by `logicn-core`.
- LogicN source syntax must use generic targets such as `low_bit_ai` and
  `ternary_ai`, not a backend name such as BitNet.
- BitNet should be treated as one optional backend for compatible low-bit AI
  inference when GPU, NPU or other accelerator targets are unavailable or not
  permitted.
- BitNet ternary weights and other model weight formats must not be treated as
  LogicN `Tri` truth semantics.
- AI inference declarations must include explicit model reference, context
  limit, output token limit, timeout, thread limit and memory estimate.
- AI output must be untrusted by default and must not directly authorize
  security, payment, access-control or other high-impact decisions.
- Compute target selection reports must record when `low_bit_ai` or
  `ternary_ai` was selected, which backend was used and why higher-preference
  targets were not selected.
- AI accelerator and photonic targets must be optional. CPU-compatible fallback
  must remain the baseline for LogicN developer workflows.

## Passive LLM Cache Requirements

- LogicN may support passive LLM, embedding, RAG/chunk, schema-output,
  code-analysis and AI-context caches.
- Passive cache means developers call the LLM normally and LogicN decides
  whether to read, write, bypass or block cache use according to policy.
- Passive LLM caching must be automatic only when the input and output are safe,
  typed, source-tracked, privacy-checked and reportable.
- LogicN must not cache raw secrets, API keys, access tokens, payment card data,
  authentication headers, raw customer chat messages, medical data, legal case
  data, private documents, unredacted personal data, webhook secrets, one-time
  codes or session cookies by default.
- LogicN must not cache unvalidated free-text LLM output by default. Cacheable
  LLM output should pass typed schema validation, required-field validation,
  confidence validation where relevant, unsafe-content checks and secret-leakage
  checks.
- LLM cache keys must include provider, model, model version, system prompt
  hash, input hash, context hash, output schema hash, tool manifest hash,
  temperature, `top_p`, seed where available, LogicN version, security policy
  hash and package/source hashes where relevant.
- Embedding cache keys must include text hash, embedding model, model version,
  normalisation settings, chunking settings, provider and project/tenant
  isolation key.
- Semantic cache must be disabled by default and require explicit policy. It
  must be denied by default for payments, legal decisions, medical advice,
  security decisions, webhooks, financial calculations and access control.
- Passive LLM cache entries must be invalidated when model, model version,
  system prompt, output schema, tools, RAG context, security policy, LogicN
  compiler version, package version, source file or project/tenant isolation
  key changes.
- Production LLM cache stores must require tenant isolation, encryption at rest,
  TTL, redaction, purge support, audit logging and permission checks.
- Passive LLM cache reports must include enabled state, store type, hits,
  misses, blocked counts, blocked reasons, models used, semantic-cache status,
  invalidation facts and whether secret values were stored.
- Passive LLM cache reports must not include prompt text, raw user text, secret
  values, credentials, authorization headers, cookies or unredacted personal
  data by default.

## Deployment Auto-Configuration Requirements

- LogicN deployment must be based on portable project intent, not developer
  machine assumptions.
- Deployment declarations should support target auto-detection, runtime
  capability profiles, architecture-aware builds, generated deployment
  artifacts, preflight checks, health checks, readiness checks, smoke tests,
  stability watches and rollback metadata.
- Kubernetes must be treated as an optional deployment target, not a required
  runtime for every LogicN app.
- Basic Kubernetes output may include Deployment, Service, Ingress or Gateway,
  ConfigMap, Secret references, ServiceAccount, health/readiness/startup probes,
  resource requests and limits, rollout settings and deployment reports.
- LogicN must never emit real secret values into Kubernetes YAML. Production
  Kubernetes output must prefer secret references or external secret stores and
  warn when Kubernetes Secrets are used without evidence of encryption at rest
  and least-privilege RBAC.
- Kubernetes deployment checks must block or warn on root containers, privilege
  escalation, writable root filesystems, missing resource limits, missing
  readiness probes, `.env` mounts, broad service accounts, `cluster-admin`,
  images tagged `latest`, missing image signatures where required and missing
  rollback metadata.
- Advanced Kubernetes policy packs, NetworkPolicy generation beyond basic
  declaration, RBAC minimisation, admission policy templates, secret-store
  integration templates, multi-environment overlays and production hardening
  automation must remain reserved enterprise work under `docs/ENTERPRISE.md`
  unless explicitly unlocked.
- Git-tracked deployment files should describe intent and policy. Local machine
  profiles, runtime profiles, tuning results, deployment secret metadata,
  benchmark caches and `.env` files must not be committed.
- Deployment checks must block production deployment when required secrets are
  missing, hardcoded secrets are detected, `.env` files are included in build
  output, debug mode is enabled, dev packages are included, package permissions
  are unknown, unsafe network rules are present, health/readiness endpoints are
  missing, smoke tests fail or the selected target does not match the runtime.
- Runtime capability profiles must contain metadata only. They must not contain
  secret values, private logs, raw credentials, authorization headers, cookies
  or unredacted personal data.
- Production first boot should detect operating system, architecture, CPU
  features, container status and memory limits before selecting runtime and
  compute settings.
- Runtime auto-tuning must be bounded, safe and time-limited. It must not run
  extreme benchmarks in production.
- Compute auto-selection must verify target-specific outputs against a safe
  reference where correctness or precision matters, and must fall back to a safe
  CPU scalar path when target-specific acceleration is unavailable or unsafe.
- Traffic must not be enabled until readiness checks and required smoke tests
  pass.
- Deployment reports must include target detection, build target, secret
  availability, secret exposure status, security/dependency/memory/deployment
  report status, health/readiness/smoke-test status, traffic status and rollback
  availability.
- AI-readable deployment context must include only non-secret metadata and must
  explicitly list data that must not be exposed.

## Runtime Naming Requirement

- `logicn-framework-app-kernel` must remain the secure application boundary package.
- A future `logicn-core-runtime` package, if added, should be the LogicN execution engine for
  compiled or checked LogicN code.
- `logicn-framework-app-kernel` must not be renamed to `logicn-core-runtime`, because API policy and
  code execution are separate responsibilities.

## Out of Scope

- Product-specific app features before a product domain is selected.
- Full-framework behavior inside `logicn-core` or `logicn-framework-app-kernel`.
- Mandatory ORM, CMS, admin UI, template engine or frontend framework design.
- Treating project graph output as a security or compiler authority.
- Treating BitNet, Graphify or any named backend as LogicN language syntax.
- Treating neural networks, neuromorphic models or AI accelerators as mandatory
  core language features.
- Requiring future hardware for the baseline LogicN developer workflow.

## Success Criteria

- The root README and package docs explain the workspace clearly.
- Package boundaries are explicit and enforced through documentation and tests
  where code exists.
- Project graph outputs can be regenerated and used by AI tools.
- `LogicN task` can load, validate, dry-run and report safe task plans.
- Secrets are never committed or emitted in reports.
- A future app can add domain requirements without moving language or framework
  responsibilities into the wrong package.
