## Non-Functional Requirements

- The app must be secure.
- The app must validate input.
- The app must handle errors safely.
- The app must not expose secrets.
- The app must be maintainable.
- The app must be documented.

## Workspace Requirements

- The LO language core must live in `packages/lo-core/`.
- LO multi-state logic concepts such as `Tri`, `Logic<N>` and future Omni
  logic must live in `packages/lo-logic/`.
- LO vector value, lane and operation concepts must live in
  `packages/lo-vector/`.
- LO compute planning, capability, budget and target selection concepts must
  live in `packages/lo-compute/`.
- Photonic and wavelength hardware concepts must live in
  `packages/lo-photonic/`.
- Binary/native target planning must live in `packages/lo-target-binary/`.
- Photonic backend target planning must live in
  `packages/lo-target-photonic/`.
- The optional LO Secure App Kernel must live in `packages/lo-app-kernel/`.
- The built-in LO HTTP API server must live in `packages/lo-api-server/`.
- The LO developer CLI must live in `packages/lo-cli/`.
- Safe LO project automation must live in `packages/lo-tasks/`.
- Bespoke app source must live in `packages/app/`.
- App documentation must live in `docs/`.
- Language documentation must stay within `packages/lo-core/`.
- Full framework features must stay outside `packages/lo-core/` and
  `packages/lo-app-kernel/`.
- Current development may use one root Git repository while package boundaries
  are still being shaped.
- Later, `packages/` may become its own Git repository so the LO packages can
  be imported into different frameworks.
- If `packages/` has its own `.git`, it must be added intentionally as a
  submodule or standalone nested repository, and the framework root must treat
  it as an external dependency.

## Secure App Kernel Requirements

- The kernel may define typed API boundaries, validation, auth policy,
  rate-limit policy, idempotency, replay protection, jobs and runtime reports.
- The kernel must receive raw requests and pass only typed, validated values to
  LO handlers unless unsafe raw access is explicitly declared.
- The kernel must enforce `boot.lo` security policy at runtime where a runtime
  adapter is present.
- The kernel must support adapter boundaries for HTTP servers, queue backends,
  storage backends and identity providers.
- The kernel must not include CMS features, admin dashboards, page builders,
  mandatory ORM design, mandatory template engines or frontend framework syntax.
- The kernel package must support a non-compiled checked Run Mode smoke test
  for validating simple `.lo` execution during framework development.

## API Server Requirements

- `lo-api-server` must be an HTTP serving package, not a full web framework.
- `lo-api-server` must load route manifests generated from LO API contracts.
- `lo-api-server` must normalise HTTP requests before passing them to
  `lo-app-kernel`.
- `lo-api-server` must enforce server-level limits such as body size, timeout,
  connection shutdown and safe response writing.
- `lo-api-server` must ask `lo-app-kernel` for auth, validation, idempotency and
  typed route execution decisions.
- `lo-api-server` must redact secrets, bearer tokens, cookies and SecureString
  values from logs and reports.
- Bespoke frameworks may either use `lo-api-server` or call `lo-app-kernel`
  directly from their own HTTP layer.

## CLI and Task Requirements

- `lo-cli` must provide developer commands for checking, building, running,
  serving, reporting, route inspection, security checks and task execution.
- `lo-cli` may coordinate `lo-core`, future compiler/runtime packages,
  `lo-api-server` and `lo-tasks`, but must not contain application behaviour.
- `lo-tasks` must provide safe, typed project automation with declared effects
  and permissions.
- `lo-tasks` must deny raw shell execution by default.
- Unsafe shell support, if added later, must be explicit, permissioned,
  timeout-limited, reported and redacted.
- Both packages must redact secrets, bearer tokens, cookies, `SecureString`
  values and private key material from output and reports.

## Logic and Photonic Package Requirements

- `lo-logic` must own `Tri`, `Logic<N>`, future Omni logic, multi-state truth
  tables, conversion rules and logic reports.
- `lo-photonic` must own wavelength, phase, amplitude, optical signal, optical
  channel, photonic simulation and photonic target planning concepts.
- `lo-photonic` may map logic states from `lo-logic` to photonic
  representations, but it must not own the logic semantics.
- `lo-vector` must own vector values, dimensions, lanes, vector operation rules
  and vector reports.
- `lo-compute` must own compute planning, capability, budget, offload and
  target selection concepts.
- `lo-target-binary` must own binary/native target planning and artefact
  metadata.
- `lo-target-photonic` must own photonic backend target planning and may use
  `lo-photonic` concepts.

## Runtime Naming Requirement

- `lo-app-kernel` must remain the secure application boundary package.
- A future `lo-runtime` package, if added, should be the LO execution engine for
  compiled or checked LO code.
- `lo-app-kernel` must not be renamed to `lo-runtime`, because API policy and
  code execution are separate responsibilities.

## Out of Scope

- Item 2
- Item 3
