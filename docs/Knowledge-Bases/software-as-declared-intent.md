# Software As Declared Intent

LogicN is built on the idea that modern code should not only execute. It should
communicate system intent.

## Core Statement

```text
Modern coding is becoming less about writing machine instructions and more about
expressing system intent in a way that humans, AI and tools can understand,
check and safely execute.
```

## LogicN Statement

LogicN programs should clearly express:

```text
methods
rules
policies
data flows
security boundaries
permissions
effects
reports
```

The goal is for developers, AI systems, compilers and runtime tools to
understand what the software is meant to do before it runs.

## How LogicN Expresses Intent

LogicN uses:

```text
data       = what information exists, enters and leaves
flow       = what runs
permission = what is allowed
boundary   = where trust changes
report     = proof of what was checked
```

## Security Value

Declared intent lets LogicN check whether implementation behavior matches the
declared model:

```text
Does this flow require the right permission?
Does this response expose only allowed data?
Does this boundary validate input?
Does this code perform only declared effects?
Does this report prove the decision?
```

## AI Value

AI tools should not need to guess architecture from scattered code. They should
read declared data, flows, permissions, boundaries and reports, then propose
changes that preserve those declarations.

## Rule

When LogicN accepts a feature, it should be visible to humans, AI and tools
through types, permissions, policies, effects, source maps or reports.
