```

In the current and future structure, `packages-lo/` is the reusable LO package repository that
can be imported by multiple frameworks. It should be mounted intentionally, for
example as a Git submodule or standalone nested repository. The framework root
remains its own repository. `packages/` is reserved for normal app/vendor
packages from the host ecosystem.

`lo-devtools-*` packages are development-only inspection and assistant-context
packages. `lo-tools-*` packages are broader diagnostics, benchmark or release
utilities that may run in development or staging. Neither family should be
required by production runtime installs.

The proposed long-term application layout separates host ecosystem dependencies
from LO dependencies:

```text
package.json
package-lo.json
lo.lock.json
packages/
packages-lo/
```

`package-lo.json` should describe selected LO packages and profiles.
`lo.lock.json` should lock versions, source refs, checksums and profile
selection. This is a planned package-management boundary; current beta tooling
does not yet resolve LO packages from those files.

The Secure App Kernel is a partial framework layer. It enforces safe runtime
boundaries, but it must not become a full Laravel, Django, React or WordPress
style framework.

`lo-framework-api-server` is the built-in HTTP transport package for API services. It
serves HTTP, loads route manifests, applies server-level limits and passes
normalised requests into `lo-framework-app-kernel`. It must not own auth decisions,
business logic, ORM design, CMS features or frontend rendering.

`lo-core-cli` is the developer command tool. It coordinates compiler, runtime, API
server and task packages, but it must not own application behaviour.

`lo-core-tasks` is the safe automation layer. It runs typed tasks with declared
effects and permissions. Raw shell is disabled by default and should only exist
later as explicit unsafe compatibility.

`lo-tools-benchmark` is developer diagnostics. It should test correctness,
predictability, target fallback and privacy-safe reporting across normal
machines, CPU-only systems, GPU systems and future accelerator targets. It must
not run automatically in production, and light mode must stay bounded so it is
safe for ordinary development machines.

`lo-devtools-project-graph` is developer tooling for architecture inspection and AI
assistant context. It may generate graph JSON, an HTML view, a graph report and
an AI map, but it must not become a source of truth for compiler validation,
runtime enforcement or security decisions.

Developer-only packages should be resolved through an explicit development
profile. Production lockfiles, runtime package manifests and application
deployments should not pull `lo-devtools-*` or development-only `lo-tools-*`
packages unless a maintainer opts into a development or staging mode.

`lo-finance-core` is a domain package group. Early work should define deterministic
finance maths, market-data types, FIX integration contracts, audit evidence,
calendar/session rules and risk/pricing boundaries. It must not make LO a live
exchange engine, HFT engine, broker-dealer platform, settlement system,
clearing system or custody platform.

`lo-core-logic` owns logic semantics such as `Tri`, `Logic<N>` and Omni.
`lo-core-photonic` owns photonic concepts, representation models and simulation
vocabulary. Photonic mappings may consume logic states, but logic semantics stay
in `lo-core-logic`, and backend target planning stays in `lo-target-photonic`.

`lo-core-vector` owns vector, matrix and tensor value concepts. `lo-core-compute` owns
compute planning and target selection. `lo-ai` owns generic AI inference
contracts and safety policy. `lo-ai-agent` owns supervised AI agent definitions,
tool permissions, task groups, merge policies and reports. `lo-ai-neural` owns
neural-network model, layer, inference and training boundaries.
`lo-ai-neuromorphic` owns spike/event-driven model contracts. `lo-ai-lowbit` owns
low-bit and ternary model references, backend selection and CPU inference
plans. `lo-target-cpu` owns CPU capability and fallback planning, while
`lo-cpu-kernels` owns optimized CPU kernel contracts. `lo-target-binary`,
`lo-target-wasm`, `lo-target-gpu`, `lo-target-ai-accelerator` and
`lo-target-photonic` own target-specific planning for binary/native,
WebAssembly, GPU, AI accelerator, optical I/O and photonic backends.
`lo-tools-benchmark` may consume these packages to test target behavior, but target
capability semantics stay in the target packages.

AI accelerator support is passive and vendor-neutral. LO source should prefer
`ai_accelerator`; concrete devices such as Intel Gaudi 3 are backend profiles in
`lo-target-ai-accelerator`, selected by config, adapter policy or capability
detection. The first practical integration path should use controlled adapters
over existing AI frameworks rather than a native LO compiler backend. Reports
should record backend profile, framework adapter, precision, memory tier,
topology and fallback.

Optical I/O is different from photonic compute. LO should model Intel Silicon
Photonics and OCI-style devices as high-bandwidth interconnects for moving data
between CPUs, GPUs, accelerators, memory pools and storage. They are not a
photonic CPU target. `lo-core-compute` owns the `optical_io` target selection and
data-movement cost model, while `lo-target-photonic` owns optical I/O planning
reports, topology hints, fallback paths and transfer-format recommendations.
This lets LO optimize data locality, tensor streaming, schema-compressed
transfers, accelerator placement and remote memory safety without pretending
that optical I/O performs normal application computation.

Neural networks are typed compute workloads, not normal app syntax. LO can
define model, inference and training boundaries through `lo-ai-neural`, while
tensor shapes stay in `lo-core-vector` and target selection stays in `lo-core-compute`.
Parallel AI agents are supervised orchestration workloads, not uncontrolled
background processes. Agent control, tool permissions and merge policies belong
in `lo-ai-agent`; structured concurrency and cancellation belong in `lo-core-runtime`;
heavy inference or vector work should still go through `compute flow` and
`lo-core-compute`.
Low-bit AI is a CPU fallback path for AI inference, not a core language feature.
When a compute policy requests AI inference, LO can prefer AI accelerator, GPU
or NPU targets and fall back to `low_bit_ai` or CPU when the model, backend and
capability checks pass. BitNet may be selected as the backend today, but LO
source syntax should remain generic so future low-bit standards can replace it.
Target selection reports must record the selected backend, fallback reason,
token and memory limits, thread limit and warnings.

`lo-core-security` owns shared security primitives and report contracts. Runtime auth
and API policy enforcement remain in `lo-framework-app-kernel`. `lo-core-config` owns
configuration loading contracts, and `lo-core-reports` owns shared report shapes.

`lo-core-config` validates project configuration, resolves environment modes and
produces runtime handoff objects with structured diagnostics. It represents
environment variables by safe references only: names, required flags, secret
flags, scopes and optional non-secret defaults. Production strictness policy
checks belong here, while secret protection and redaction remain in
`lo-core-security`.

Controlled recovery belongs across language, runtime and report layers.
`lo-core` may describe resilient flow syntax direction, but `lo-core-runtime` owns
supervision, cancellation, retry scheduling and checkpoint/resume hooks.
`lo-core-reports` owns processing report shapes for partial success, retries,
quarantine and failure summaries. `lo-framework-app-kernel` should still prefer
transactions, rollback, idempotency and hold-for-review for security-sensitive
API workflows.

`lo-framework-app-kernel` should not be renamed to `lo-core-runtime`. A future `lo-core-runtime`
package should execute compiled or checked LO code. The app kernel should
remain the secure application/API boundary that controls validation, auth,
idempotency, limits, jobs and runtime reports.

## Repository Boundaries

The current template keeps all files in one root Git repository while the
package boundaries are still being shaped.

Later, split reusable LO packages into their own `packages-lo/` repository:

```text
light-framework/.git
light-framework/packages-lo/.git
```

This is appropriate when the same packages need to be imported into different
framework repositories. At that point, the root framework repository should
treat `packages-lo/` as an external dependency, not as ordinary tracked child
files.

## Checked Run Smoke Tests

The framework layer can be exercised without compiling by running LO core
checked Run Mode against `.lo` test fixtures.

```text
packages-lo/lo-framework-app-kernel/tests/
`-- hello-world.lo
```

The current smoke test runs through the LO core prototype:

```bash
npm.cmd --prefix packages-lo/lo-framework-app-kernel run test:hello
```
