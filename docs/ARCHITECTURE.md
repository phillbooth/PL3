# Architecture

## Overview

This workspace separates the LO language core from the bespoke app that uses it.
Language documentation, compiler notes, examples and schemas live in
`packages/lo-core/`. Compiler pipeline contracts live in
`packages/lo-compiler/`. Runtime execution contracts live in
`packages/lo-runtime/`. Security primitives live in `packages/lo-security/`.
Configuration and shared reports live in `packages/lo-config/` and
`packages/lo-reports/`. Multi-state logic concepts live in `packages/lo-logic/`.
Vector concepts live in `packages/lo-vector/`. Compute planning concepts live in
`packages/lo-compute/`. Photonic and wavelength concepts live in
`packages/lo-photonic/`. Binary/native target planning lives in
`packages/lo-target-binary/`, WebAssembly target planning lives in
`packages/lo-target-wasm/`, GPU target planning lives in
`packages/lo-target-gpu/`, and photonic target backend planning lives in
`packages/lo-target-photonic/`. The
optional Secure App Kernel design lives in `packages/lo-app-kernel/`. The
built-in HTTP API server package lives in `packages/lo-api-server/`. Developer command
tooling lives in `packages/lo-cli/`, and safe project automation lives in
`packages/lo-tasks/`. App source and build configuration live in
`packages/app/`. App planning and operational documentation live in `docs/`.

## Main Structure

Current single-repository structure:

```text
LO-app/
|-- docs/
|-- packages/
|   |-- lo-core/
|   |-- lo-compiler/
|   |-- lo-runtime/
|   |-- lo-security/
|   |-- lo-config/
|   |-- lo-reports/
|   |-- lo-logic/
|   |-- lo-vector/
|   |-- lo-compute/
|   |-- lo-photonic/
|   |-- lo-target-binary/
|   |-- lo-target-wasm/
|   |-- lo-target-gpu/
|   |-- lo-target-photonic/
|   |-- lo-app-kernel/
|   |-- lo-api-server/
|   |-- lo-cli/
|   |-- lo-tasks/
|   `-- app/
`-- tools/
```

Future split-repository structure:

```text
light-framework/
|-- .git
|-- packages/
|   |-- .git
|   |-- lo-core/
|   |-- lo-compiler/
|   |-- lo-runtime/
|   |-- lo-security/
|   |-- lo-config/
|   |-- lo-reports/
|   |-- lo-logic/
|   |-- lo-vector/
|   |-- lo-compute/
|   |-- lo-photonic/
|   |-- lo-target-binary/
|   |-- lo-target-wasm/
|   |-- lo-target-gpu/
|   |-- lo-target-photonic/
|   |-- lo-app-kernel/
|   |-- lo-api-server/
|   |-- lo-cli/
|   `-- lo-tasks/
|-- app/
`-- framework files
```

In the future structure, `packages/` is a reusable LO package repository that
can be imported by multiple frameworks. It should be mounted intentionally, for
example as a Git submodule or standalone nested repository. The framework root
remains its own repository.

LO Full Frameworks
  web frameworks, CMS, admin UI, frontend adapters, ORM and template systems
```

The Secure App Kernel is a partial framework layer. It enforces safe runtime
boundaries, but it must not become a full Laravel, Django, React or WordPress
style framework.

`lo-api-server` is the built-in HTTP transport package for API services. It
serves HTTP, loads route manifests, applies server-level limits and passes
normalised requests into `lo-app-kernel`. It must not own auth decisions,
business logic, ORM design, CMS features or frontend rendering.

`lo-cli` is the developer command tool. It coordinates compiler, runtime, API
server and task packages, but it must not own application behaviour.

`lo-tasks` is the safe automation layer. It runs typed tasks with declared
effects and permissions. Raw shell is disabled by default and should only exist
later as explicit unsafe compatibility.

`lo-logic` owns logic semantics such as `Tri`, `Logic<N>` and Omni. `lo-photonic`
owns photonic representation and target planning. Photonic mappings may consume
logic states, but logic semantics stay in `lo-logic`.

`lo-vector` owns vector values and vector operation concepts. `lo-compute` owns
compute planning and target selection. `lo-target-binary`, `lo-target-wasm`,
`lo-target-gpu` and `lo-target-photonic` own target-specific planning for
binary/native, WebAssembly, GPU and photonic backends.

`lo-security` owns shared security primitives and report contracts. Runtime auth
and API policy enforcement remain in `lo-app-kernel`. `lo-config` owns
configuration loading contracts, and `lo-reports` owns shared report shapes.

`lo-config` validates project configuration, resolves environment modes and
produces runtime handoff objects with structured diagnostics. It represents
environment variables by safe references only: names, required flags, secret
flags, scopes and optional non-secret defaults. Production strictness policy
checks belong here, while secret protection and redaction remain in
`lo-security`.

`lo-app-kernel` should not be renamed to `lo-runtime`. A future `lo-runtime`
package should execute compiled or checked LO code. The app kernel should
remain the secure application/API boundary that controls validation, auth,
idempotency, limits, jobs and runtime reports.

## Repository Boundaries

The current template keeps all files in one root Git repository while the
package boundaries are still being shaped.

Later, split reusable LO packages into their own `packages/` repository:

```text
light-framework/.git
light-framework/packages/.git
```

This is appropriate when the same packages need to be imported into different
framework repositories. At that point, the root framework repository should
treat `packages/` as an external dependency, not as ordinary tracked child
files.

## Checked Run Smoke Tests

The framework layer can be exercised without compiling by running LO core
checked Run Mode against `.lo` test fixtures.

```text
packages/lo-app-kernel/tests/
`-- hello-world.lo
```

The current smoke test runs through the LO core prototype:

```bash
npm.cmd --prefix packages/lo-app-kernel run test:hello
```
