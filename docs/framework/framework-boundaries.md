# Framework: Boundaries

## Purpose

Boundaries define trust crossings in LogicN applications.

## Short Definition

A boundary is any place where data or authority crosses from one trust area into
another.

## Boundary Types

```text
route/API
package/plugin
storage
external API
event/queue
AI/tool
compute target
vault
native interop
```

## Syntax Examples

```logicn
boundary storage UsersDatabase {
  type postgres
  model User
  permission use user_storage_access
}
```

```logicn
boundary external PaymentProvider {
  type api
  request ChargePaymentRequest
  response ChargePaymentResponse
  permission use payment_provider_access
}
```

## Security Rules

- Every boundary crossing must validate data.
- Every boundary crossing must check permission.
- Every boundary crossing must be reportable.
- Unknown trust must default to untrusted.
- Native, AI/tool and external boundaries require stricter reports.
