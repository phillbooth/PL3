# Rust In Financial Markets

Rust can be beneficial to financial markets because it sits between C++
performance and safer modern language design.

It is not a magic replacement for C++, Java or Python. Its strongest role is in
systems where speed, reliability, safety and predictable runtime behaviour all
matter.

Financial systems often have a simple problem:

```text
small bugs can become expensive bugs
small delays can become expensive delays
small outages can become market, legal or reputational problems
```

Rust helps most in the parts of a financial system where correctness and
performance both matter.

## Where Rust Helps

| Area | Why Rust helps |
|---|---|
| Low-latency trading | Native performance, no garbage collector pauses, strong memory control and predictable execution. |
| Market data feeds | Can parse, normalize and distribute high-volume streaming data quickly and safely. |
| Order routing | Strong types can reduce mistakes in order state, venue selection, execution policy and routing logic. |
| Risk engines | Helps model limits, exposure, currencies, products and risk states with stricter type rules. |
| Trading gateways | Good for fast network services that need stable latency and high uptime. |
| Exchange connectivity | Useful for FIX, binary protocols, WebSocket feeds and custom exchange APIs. |
| Crypto and exchange systems | Strong fit for signing, wallet infrastructure, matching engines and high-throughput networking. |
| Settlement and reconciliation | Good for reliable batch and streaming pipelines with explicit error handling. |
| Security tooling | Strong for parsers, scanners, network tools, agents and infrastructure services. |
| Backtesting engines | Can run simulations much faster than typical Python code. |
| Python hot paths | Python can stay for research while Rust handles the performance-critical engine. |
| Market surveillance | Useful for high-volume event scanning, suspicious pattern detection and alert pipelines. |
| Ledger and event systems | Strong typing and append-only event models fit audit-heavy systems. |
| Data validation | Good for validating trade messages, pricing data, reference data and regulatory feeds. |

## Why Finance Likes Languages Like Rust

Financial systems often care about:

```text
latency
throughput
uptime
correctness
security
auditability
memory safety
predictable runtime behaviour
operational stability
clear failure handling
```

Rust helps because it provides:

```text
native binary speed
no garbage collector
strong compile-time checks
safe concurrency
memory safety
good networking performance
C/C++ interop
Python interop
WASM support
cross-platform deployment
small runtime footprint
```

The no-garbage-collector point matters. Java, C#, Go and other managed
languages can be excellent, but garbage collection can introduce runtime pauses.
In many financial systems this is acceptable. In low-latency trading, market
data handling or real-time risk checks, unpredictable pauses can be a problem.

## Compared With Python

Python is widely used in finance for:

```text
research
data science
machine learning
strategy testing
notebooks
quant analysis
reporting
automation
```

Python is excellent for exploration, but it is usually not ideal for the
lowest-latency execution layer unless it calls native libraries underneath.

A practical architecture is:

```text
Python
  research, modelling, notebooks, strategy testing

Rust
  execution engine, market data, order routing, risk checks, fast simulation

Database / message queue
  shared data, events, audit trail and reporting pipeline
```

Rust does not need to replace Python. It can power the parts where Python is too
slow, too memory-heavy or too unpredictable.

Rust can also integrate with Python through native extension tooling. This lets
a quant team keep Python notebooks while moving expensive calculations,
simulations or parsers into Rust.

## Compared With C++

C++ is still very strong in finance, especially in trading. It has decades of
adoption, large libraries, experienced teams and excellent performance.

But C++ mistakes can lead to:

```text
memory corruption
use-after-free
buffer overflows
data races
undefined behaviour
hard-to-debug crashes
security vulnerabilities
```

Rust is attractive because it prevents many of these problems at compile time
while still producing fast native binaries.

That said, Rust adoption in finance is usually gradual. Banks, exchanges and
funds already have large C++, Java and Python systems. Rust is more likely to
appear first in:

```text
new services
high-risk C++ replacements
network services
crypto infrastructure
data pipelines
security tools
simulation engines
latency-sensitive components
```

## Strong Use Cases

### Market Data Feed Handlers

Market data systems need to handle huge message volumes.

Rust can help with:

```text
binary protocol parsing
message normalization
deduplication
sequence gap detection
timestamp handling
symbol mapping
fan-out to internal consumers
```

A Rust feed handler can be fast while still making invalid states harder to
represent.

### Order Routing

Order routing has many states:

```text
new
accepted
partially filled
filled
cancel requested
cancelled
rejected
expired
```

Rust's type system can help prevent invalid transitions, such as cancelling an
order that has already fully filled.

### Pre-Trade Risk

Before an order goes to market, the system may need to check:

```text
position limits
credit limits
notional limits
price bands
fat-finger checks
venue permissions
instrument restrictions
regulatory rules
```

Rust is useful here because risk logic needs to be fast, correct and auditable.

### Backtesting And Simulation

Python backtesting can be slow when simulations become large.

Rust can help with:

```text
event-driven simulation
order book replay
slippage modelling
latency modelling
large historical datasets
Monte Carlo workloads
strategy evaluation
```

Python can still control the experiment while Rust runs the engine.

### Reconciliation And Settlement

Post-trade systems need correctness more than microsecond latency.

Rust can help build reliable pipelines for:

```text
trade matching
break detection
position reconciliation
cash reconciliation
settlement status tracking
audit logs
regulatory reporting
```

This is less glamorous than trading, but often more important operationally.

## Example Trading System Split

A financial trading platform might use Rust like this:

```text
Market data feed handler
  Rust

Order book
  Rust

Pre-trade risk checks
  Rust

Order router
  Rust

Execution gateway
  Rust

Strategy research
  Python

Machine learning research
  Python

Dashboard
  TypeScript / React

Storage
  PostgreSQL / Kafka / Redis / custom event logs
```

Rust is especially useful in the middle where data must move quickly and safely.

## Safer Financial Types

Rust can model financial values carefully.

Instead of treating everything as loose values:

```text
price = 123.45
currency = "GBP"
quantity = 100
```

Rust-style design encourages strict domain types:

```text
Money<GBP>
Price
Quantity
InstrumentId
OrderId
VenueId
RiskLimit
AccountId
PortfolioId
ExecutionId
```

This helps avoid bugs such as:

```text
mixing GBP and USD
using floating point incorrectly for money
routing to the wrong venue
sending the wrong order type
exceeding risk limits
confusing price and quantity
confusing account and portfolio identifiers
```

For finance, types are not just code structure. They are safety controls.

## Explicit Error Handling

Rust encourages explicit error handling with `Result`.

That is useful for finance because many failures must be handled deliberately:

```text
market data gap
invalid order
venue disconnect
stale price
risk check failure
database timeout
duplicate trade
reconciliation break
```

Instead of unexpected exceptions appearing at runtime, Rust encourages code to
declare and handle expected failure paths.

## Concurrency Safety

Financial systems are highly concurrent:

```text
many market data feeds
many orders
many clients
many instruments
many venues
many risk checks
many background jobs
```

Rust's ownership model helps reduce data races and unsafe shared state. This is
useful for systems where concurrency bugs can cause incorrect orders, duplicated
events or inconsistent positions.

## Auditability

Finance needs audit trails.

Rust can support designs where important actions are represented as typed
events:

```text
OrderReceived
RiskChecked
OrderSent
ExecutionReceived
PositionUpdated
SettlementMatched
ReconciliationBreakDetected
```

This works well with event sourcing, append-only logs and deterministic replay.

A well-designed Rust system can make it easier to answer:

```text
what happened?
when did it happen?
which input caused it?
which rule accepted or rejected it?
can we replay it?
```

## Safer Parsers

Financial systems parse a lot of external data:

```text
FIX messages
CSV files
JSON APIs
binary market data
exchange-specific protocols
regulatory feeds
counterparty files
```

Parsers are common sources of bugs and security issues. Rust is strong for
building fast parsers that are less likely to suffer from memory corruption.

## Deployment

Rust compiles to native binaries. That can simplify some deployments:

```text
single binary services
small containers
low runtime dependency
fast startup
good fit for sidecars and agents
```

This can be useful for infrastructure tools, exchange gateways and internal
services.

## Operational Ideas For Finance Systems

Rust fits well with finance systems that use:

```text
append-only event logs
deterministic replay
typed risk decisions
immutable audit records
bounded queues
backpressure
idempotent command handling
explicit recovery states
strict configuration loading
redacted diagnostics
```

These ideas are not Rust-only, but Rust supports them well because it rewards
explicit state, explicit ownership and explicit failure paths.

## What This Suggests For LO

LO can learn from the same strengths without becoming Rust.

For LO, finance-facing design should emphasize:

```text
strict money and instrument types
no silent currency mixing
typed order states
typed risk decisions
explicit Result / Option handling
deterministic reports
safe concurrency boundaries
controlled recovery for batch workflows
fail-fast behaviour for payments and order execution
CPU/binary compatibility as a baseline
benchmarking for latency, fallback and correctness
```

Useful LO package connections:

```text
lo-core
  syntax, Result, Option, match, effects and typed records

lo-security
  redaction, secrets, permission checks and security reports

lo-reports
  audit reports, processing reports and benchmark reports

lo-runtime
  supervision, cancellation, memory policy and controlled execution

lo-compute
  target planning for fast simulation, vector ranking and AI workloads

lo-vector
  matrix, tensor and numeric workloads for modelling and backtesting

lo-benchmark
  compare behavior across CPU, GPU, low-bit and fallback targets
```

Finance is a good test domain for LO because it exposes whether the language can
handle correctness, performance, reporting and safety together.

## Where Rust Is Not Automatically Better

Rust is not always the best answer.

It can be harder to learn than Python. Hiring Rust developers may be harder than
hiring Java, Python or C++ developers. In large banks, existing infrastructure
may be too embedded to replace quickly.

Rust is best when the system needs:

```text
high performance
high reliability
low latency
memory safety
controlled concurrency
long-running stability
explicit failure handling
```

It is less useful for:

```text
quick analysis
spreadsheet-style workflows
dashboards
simple scripts
experimental notebooks
one-off reporting
```

Python is still excellent there.

## Best Summary

Rust can help financial markets by providing:

```text
C++-level performance
better memory safety
predictable runtime behaviour
safe concurrency
strong typing for financial logic
fast data processing
secure infrastructure services
reliable parsers
audit-friendly system design
```

The strongest use case is not replacing Python or C++ everywhere.

The strongest use case is using Rust for the critical execution and
infrastructure layer where mistakes, latency spikes and crashes are expensive.
