# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

This file gives guidance to AI coding tools working on this repository.

## Project Type

This is a LO application template.

The repository contains:

- LO language/package files in `packages/lo-core/`
- LO secure runtime kernel design files in `packages/lo-app-kernel/`
- Bespoke app files in `packages/app/`
- App documentation in `docs/`
- Helper scripts and generators in `tools/`

## Important Rules

- Do not place app-specific documentation inside `packages/lo-core/`.
- Do not place full-framework, CMS, admin UI, ORM or frontend framework design inside `packages/lo-core/`.
- Do not place LO language documentation inside `docs/`.
- Keep the repository root clean.
- Do not commit secrets.
- Do not invent LO syntax without documenting it.
- Update relevant docs when changing architecture, requirements, security, API or deployment behaviour.

## Project Graph for AI Tools

Use the generated project graph to understand package ownership, docs, reports
and relationships before making broad architecture or package changes.

Primary graph outputs:

- `build/graph/lo-project-graph.json`
- `build/graph/LO_GRAPH_REPORT.md`
- `build/graph/lo-ai-map.md`
- `build/graph/lo-project-graph.html`

If `build/graph/lo-project-graph.json` is missing, or if the graph appears out
of date after changes to `AGENTS.md`, `lo.workspace.json`, `docs/`, package
READMEs, package TODOs, package manifests or package source contracts, run from
the repository root:

```powershell
node packages\lo-cli\dist\index.js graph --out build\graph
```

Use graph query commands when package ownership or relationships are unclear:

```powershell
node packages\lo-cli\dist\index.js graph query lo-security --out build\graph
node packages\lo-cli\dist\index.js graph explain package:lo-security --out build\graph
node packages\lo-cli\dist\index.js graph path package:lo-project-graph report:project-graph --out build\graph
```

The project graph is advisory. It helps AI and humans navigate the repository,
but it does not replace compiler checks, security rules, tests or package
boundary instructions in this file.

## Coding Rules

- Use strict typing.
- Handle undefined values explicitly.
- Handle errors explicitly.
- Keep files focused.
- Prefer small modules over large files.
- Keep compiler output out of Git unless specifically required.

## Documentation Rules

When adding or changing features, update:

- `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/TASKS.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`

## Security Rules

- Never store real secrets in source control.
- Use `.env.example` for placeholder environment variables.
- Validate inputs.
- Avoid unsafe dynamic code execution.
- Keep runtime configuration separate from compiled output.
