# LogicN Agent

`logicn-ai-agent` is the package for supervised AI agent definitions, tool
permissions, task groups, typed messages, visibility scopes, approval gates,
merge policies and agent reports.

It belongs in:

```text
/packages-logicn/logicn-ai-agent
```

Use this package for:

```text
AgentDefinition
AgentToolPermission
AgentVisibilityScope
AgentMessageSchema
AgentDataExchangePolicy
AgentSecretPolicy
AgentMemoryPolicy
AgentCachePolicy
AgentSandboxPolicy
AgentLimits
AgentTaskGroupPlan
AgentResult
AgentMergePolicy
AgentReport
```

## Multi-Agent Runtime Model

LogicN agents are untrusted workers by default.

Agents must not directly access:

```text
files
.env
raw secrets
databases
network
terminal
Git
other agents
deployment tools
LLM memory
```

Agents receive typed inputs and may only perform declared actions through the
LogicN agent runtime. The runtime enforces policy through:

```text
supervisor agent
agent registry
typed message bus
tool gateway
secret guard
memory guard
cache guard
sandbox manager
human approval gate
audit report generator
```

The detailed runtime design lives in `../../docs/MULTI_AGENT_RUNTIME.md`.

## Boundary

`logicn-ai-agent` describes typed agent orchestration contracts. It does not own
model inference, vector math, target selection, runtime scheduling internals,
sandbox implementation or security primitive implementation.

Related packages:

| Package | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `logicn-core-runtime` | structured concurrency, cancellation, timeout and supervision runtime |
| `logicn-core-security` | permissions, redaction, secret guards, unsafe reports and policy checks |
| `logicn-ai` | generic AI inference contracts and safety policy |
| `logicn-core-compute` | compute target planning and fallback reports |
| `logicn-core-vector` | vector, matrix, tensor and embedding operations |
| `logicn-target-cpu` | CPU fallback and orchestration baseline |
| `logicn-target-gpu` | GPU target planning for heavy compute |

Agents must be:

```text
typed
supervised
permissioned
bounded
cancelable
reportable
sandboxable
cache-guarded
approval-aware
```

## Default Denies

Agents must deny these by default:

```text
read .env
read raw secrets
write files directly
delete files
install dependencies
run shell commands
access production databases
deploy to production
send emails to real users
process payments
modify their own permissions
create more powerful agents
communicate directly with other agents
disable audit logs
```

Agents should normally propose code patches, docs changes, tests, reports and
deployment requests. Applying dangerous changes requires explicit policy and
human approval.

Final rule:

```text
logicn-ai-agent owns agent contracts.
logicn-core-runtime owns execution supervision.
logicn-core-compute owns heavy compute planning.
logicn-core-security owns permission and safety policy.
```
