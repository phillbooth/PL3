# Secure App Kernel Requirements

## Core Requirements

- Provide a safe request lifecycle for LogicN applications.
- Decode raw API input into strict typed values before handlers run.
- Enforce route, webhook and job security policy declared by LogicN source.
- Treat routes, typed actions/handlers, policies, effects and reports as the
  secure API core. Traditional controllers must not be required by the app
  kernel.
- Allow controller-style grouping only as optional framework sugar that compiles
  into the same route graph and does not hide auth, CSRF, object access,
  idempotency, validation, limits, audit or effects.
- Support auth provider declarations without hard-coding one identity system.
- Support idempotency and replay protection for risky side effects.
- Support memory, timeout, concurrency and rate-limit policies.
- Support request-scoped Structured Await policy so child work is cancelled,
  completed or queued according to explicit route/job policy.
- Deny hidden background work by default; require typed queue/job handoff for
  work that outlives a request.
- Support queue and job contracts without becoming a queue product.
- Generate machine-readable runtime and audit reports.
- Provide a non-compiled checked Run Mode smoke test for basic framework
  development feedback.

## Boundary Requirements

- The kernel is optional.
- LogicN core must remain usable without the kernel.
- Frameworks can build on the kernel.
- The kernel must not become a CMS, admin UI, ORM, page builder, frontend
  framework or template system.

## Example Stack

```text
LogicN language
  -> LogicN Secure App Kernel
  -> LogicN HTTP Adapter for Node / native server / WASM edge
  -> optional framework such as LogicN Web, LogicN CMS, LogicN API Framework, React adapter or Angular adapter
```

## Test Requirements

The package should keep a hello-world `.lln` fixture that runs through LogicN core
Run Mode without compiling:

```bash
npm.cmd --prefix packages-logicn/logicn-framework-app-kernel run test:hello
```

The package should also keep small checked Run Mode fixtures for vector-style
function calls, integer sums, decimal sums and JSON payload return shapes:

```bash
npm.cmd --prefix packages-logicn/logicn-framework-app-kernel test
```
