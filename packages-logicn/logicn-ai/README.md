# LogicN AI

`logicn-ai` is the package for generic AI inference contracts.

It belongs in:

```text
/packages-logicn/logicn-ai
```

Use this package for:

```text
AI model metadata
prompt and response contracts
inference options
model capability declarations
memory estimates
AI safety policy
AI inference reports
passive LLM cache policy contracts
LLM provider cache key contracts
embedding cache policy contracts
target-neutral generation contracts
```

## Boundary

`logicn-ai` should not own a model runtime, kernel implementation, GPU backend or
low-bit backend model formats. Those belong in target or adapter packages.

AI output is untrusted by default. Application policy must decide whether and
how model output can influence business decisions.

Passive LLM caching is allowed only when it is safe, typed, source-tracked,
privacy-checked and reportable. `logicn-ai` may define provider-neutral cache
policy, key material and typed output validation contracts. It must not own the
cache store implementation, provider runtime or secret scanning implementation.

See `../../docs/PASSIVE_LLM_CACHE.md`.

## Contracts

The package includes typed contracts for model registry entries, model
capabilities, prompt/options validation, target preference selection and
inference reports. Future contracts should cover passive prompt/response cache,
embedding cache, schema-output cache, code-analysis cache and AI-context cache
policy.

Final rule:

```text
logicn-ai describes AI inference.
logicn-ai describes provider-neutral passive LLM cache contracts.
logicn-ai-lowbit adapts low-bit model backends.
logicn-core-compute and target packages choose where work runs.
logicn-core-security owns secret and privacy checks.
logicn-core-reports owns shared cache report shapes.
```
