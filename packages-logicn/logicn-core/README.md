# LogicN Core

```text

LogicN, short for Logic<N>, designed to be backwards compatible with binary while supporting photonic Tri logic
represented as <N>.

A strict, memory-safe, security-first programming
language concept for API-heavy, JSON-native, AI-readable and accelerator-aware
software.

This package contains the LogicN core language design, prototype compiler, examples,
schemas and detailed language documentation.

## Status

LogicN is currently a language-design and v0.1 beta prototype project.

The prototype CLI lives in `compiler/logicn.js`. It can parse and check the
documented LogicN subset, run simple `.lln` files, generate reports, emit placeholder
build artefacts, and produce AI-readable context.

Useful commands from this package root:

```bash
npm run check
npm test
npm run build:examples
npm run verify -- build/examples
npm run generate:dev
npm run dev
node compiler/logicn.js run examples/hello.lln --generate
```

The prototype is not a production compiler. CPU-compatible checked execution and
WASM target planning are the practical v1 baseline. GPU, photonic, AI
accelerator, low-bit AI, optical I/O, ternary and Omni-logic outputs are
post-v1 planning, simulation or compatibility-report artefacts until real
backends exist.

## V1 Surface Freeze

The v1 language surface is intentionally small:

```text
core syntax and grammar
core type system
Bool, Option, Result and explicit errors
Tri semantics only where they affect the core type system
hybrid ownership memory-safety model
CPU-compatible checked execution
WASM target planning
source maps, diagnostics and machine-readable reports
```

The project should not add more active package surfaces until the syntax,
memory model, Tri/Bool boundary and parser are concrete enough to test against
real `.lln` programs.

LogicN should not claim measured speed over C#, Python, C or C++ in v0.1. It can
state performance goals and design opportunities, but measured performance
claims require an implemented compiler, a settled memory model and reproducible
benchmarks.

LogicN should also not claim to be more memory-safe than Rust. Its stronger
security claim is application-level: deny-by-default effects, typed API
boundaries, secret-safe reports, package permissions, controlled interop,
production gates and AI-safe generated project context.

LogicN should not claim to make Ethernet hardware faster. Network and Ethernet
I/O improvements should be framed as safer and more efficient application use
of the network: typed network APIs, deny-by-default network permissions, TLS
policy, route limits, backpressure, timeout policy, zero-copy planning where
available, platform-aware I/O backend selection and network reports.

LogicN should also not claim maturity next to modern C++ or Rust until the
language core is enforceable. The missing maturity checklist lives in
`docs/cpp-rust-maturity-gap.md` and covers the real compiler pipeline,
traits/protocols, deterministic cleanup, FFI, package management, tests,
async runtime semantics, source-mapped runtime errors and standard library
baseline.

LogicN should not claim legal or regulatory compliance automatically.
`docs/compliance-and-privacy.md` defines the compliance and privacy framework
direction, and the `logicn-compliance` package family owns related policy,
evidence and report contracts.

LogicN data processing belongs in packages, not directly in the core language.
`docs/data-processing.md` defines the `logicn-data` package family for HTML,
search, archive, JSON, database archive, streaming pipeline, memory-limit,
security and report contracts.

Database support should stay inside the data package family. `logicn-data-db`,
`logicn-data-model`, `logicn-data-query` and `logicn-data-response` define the
typed database boundary so stored models, inputs, queries, commands, responses,
archives and reports remain separate.

## Layer Boundary

LogicN core is the language, compiler and standard safety contract. It may define
syntax, type-checking rules and report contracts, but specialised package
semantics should live in sibling packages.

```

Detailed package-boundary guidance lives in
`docs/package-boundaries.md`.

Runtime enforcement for application request handling belongs in the optional LogicN
Secure App Kernel package in the surrounding workspace:

```text
packages-logicn/logicn-framework-app-kernel/
```

HTTP API serving belongs in the built-in API server package:

```text
packages-logicn/logicn-framework-api-server/
```

The intended layering is:

```text
LogicN Core
  language, compiler, type system, effects, memory safety, compute planning, reports

LogicN Compiler / Runtime / Security / Config / Reports
  compiler pipeline, execution, shared security, configuration and report contracts

LogicN Logic / Vector / Compute / AI / Photonic / Target Packages
  specialised LogicN concepts and target planning outside the core language package

LogicN Standard Library
  Json, Xml, SafeHtml, File, Stream, Request, Response, DateTime, Money, SecureString

LogicN Secure App Kernel
  optional runtime layer for APIs, validation, auth, rate limits, jobs and reports

LogicN API Server
  built-in HTTP API server that loads route manifests and calls the app kernel

LogicN Project Graph
  optional developer tooling for project relationship maps and AI context

Full Frameworks
  CMS, admin panels, UI systems, templates, ORM, page builders and frontend adapters
```

LogicN core may define syntax, checks and reports for safe API, webhook, job and
security contracts. The Secure App Kernel enforces those contracts at runtime
when an application opts into it. `logicn-framework-api-server` provides the default HTTP
transport for API services by loading route manifests, normalising requests and
passing them to the kernel. Full frameworks provide opinionated application
structure above or beside the kernel.

LogicN core must not become a Laravel, Django, React or WordPress-style framework.

## Core Goals

LogicN should provide:

```text
strict typing
explicit missing values
explicit errors
memory safety
security-first defaults
typed JSON decoding
API and webhook contracts
source maps
machine-readable reports
AI-readable project context
multi-target planning
CPU compatibility by default
post-v1 AI inference as an optional package layer
post-v1 GPU planning
post-v1 photonic planning
post-v1 ternary and Omni-logic simulation
```

LogicN should avoid:

```text
undefined
silent null
truthy/falsy conditions
implicit type coercion
hidden exceptions as the default error model
raw pointers in normal code
compiled secrets
silent target fallback
framework-specific native syntax
mandatory future hardware
```

## Backend Language Roadmap

The backend language gap analysis identifies the highest-value additions for
LogicN core:

| Priority | Direction |
|---|---|
| 1 | Language editions and compatibility rules |
| 2 | Final `Bool`, `Tri`, `Decision` and `LogicN` conversion rules |
| 3 | Algebraic variants, sealed state and exhaustive `match` |
| 4 | Generic constraints, traits or protocols |
| 5 | Structured concurrency, cancellation and streams |
| 6 | Deterministic resource cleanup |
| 7 | Safe compile-time metadata and attributes |
| 8 | C ABI and foreign-call boundaries |
| 9 | Matrix/vector shape rules with scalar fallback |
| 10 | Stable diagnostics and AI report schemas |

Detailed analysis lives in `docs/backend-language-gap-analysis.md`.

Comparative positioning against mature languages such as F# lives in
`docs/logicn-vs-fsharp.md`. The short version is that LogicN should not claim to be
better than F# today; it should compete from a different angle: security-first
defaults, explicit effects, AI-readable reports and target-aware planning.

## File Extension

LogicN source files use `.lln`.

Examples:

```text
boot.lln
main.lln
order-service.lln
fraud-check.lln
payment-webhook.lln
```

The recommended project entry file is `boot.lln`. Simple scripts may use
`main.lln` or a single named `.lln` file.

## Example Script

```LogicN
secure flow main() -> Result<Void, Error> {
  print("hello from LogicN")
  return Ok()
}
```

Run:

```bash
node compiler/logicn.js run examples/hello.lln
```

Short scripts should still use secure defaults:

```text
strict types enabled
memory safety enabled
undefined denied
silent null denied
unsafe denied
source maps enabled
CPU target enabled
```

## Example API Contract

```LogicN
api OrdersApi {
  POST "/orders" {
    request CreateOrderRequest
    response CreateOrderResponse
    errors [ValidationError, PaymentError]
    timeout 5s
    max_body_size 1mb
    handler createOrder
  }
}

secure flow createOrder(input: CreateOrderRequest) -> Result<CreateOrderResponse, ApiError>
effects [database.write] {
  ...
}
```

LogicN core checks the contract. A kernel-backed runtime can enforce request
validation, auth, limits, idempotency and typed handler dispatch.

The built-in `logicn-framework-api-server` package can serve the compiled API route manifest
over HTTP, but it should not own auth policy, business logic, persistence,
frontend rendering or framework conventions.

## Example Compute Block

```LogicN
data = readFile("./data.json")

compute target best verify cpu_reference {
  prefer photonic
  fallback gpu
  fallback cpu

  result = fraudModel(data)
}
```

Compute blocks should contain pure compute work. I/O should happen outside the
compute block and be passed in as strict typed data.

Generated folders such as `build/` and `.build-dev/` are ignored by default.

## Build Outputs

LogicN builds should be able to produce:

```text
app.bin
app.wasm
app.gpu.plan
app.photonic.plan
app.ternary.sim
app.omni-logic.sim
app.openapi.json
app.api-report.json
app.security-report.json
app.target-report.json
app.precision-report.json
app.memory-report.json
app.execution-report.json
app.failure-report.json
app.source-map.json
app.map-manifest.json
app.ai-guide.md
app.ai-context.json
app.build-manifest.json
```

Compiled artefacts are not secrets. Real secrets must remain outside compiled
files in environment variables, secret managers or deployment configuration.

## AI Support

LogicN should reduce the amount of source code that developers need to paste into AI
tools.

```bash
node compiler/logicn.js ai-context examples --out build/examples
node compiler/logicn.js explain examples/source-map-error.lln --for-ai
```

AI reports must be compact, deterministic, source-mapped and free of secrets.

## Non-Goals

LogicN core should not:

```text
replace every programming language
require photonic hardware
provide a full MVC framework
provide a CMS or admin dashboard
provide frontend component syntax
make JSON loosely typed
make unsafe memory normal
hide errors behind runtime magic
compile secrets into output files
```
