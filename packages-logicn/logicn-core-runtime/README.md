# LogicN Runtime

`logicn-core-runtime` is the future execution engine for checked or compiled LogicN code.

It belongs in:

```text
/packages-logicn/logicn-core-runtime
```

Use this package for:

```text
checked LogicN execution
compiled LogicN execution contracts
runtime memory policy
memory hierarchy and cache fact reporting where available
ECC/reliability fact reporting where available
effect dispatch
runtime error handling
resilient flow supervision
structured await scheduling
cancellation propagation
timeout enforcement
retry scheduling
checkpoint and resume hooks
target fallback execution
network backend dispatch contracts
network timeout and backpressure enforcement hooks
runtime reports
verified boot-profile loading
safe startup warmup hooks
```

## Startup And Boot Warmup

`logicn-core-runtime` should support verified startup rather than runtime
discovery in production.

At build/check time, LogicN may generate a boot profile containing route graph
hashes, policy graph hashes, schema validator hashes, package graph hashes and
target plans. At boot, the runtime should verify those artefacts, load the
smallest safe runtime surface and expose hooks for safe warmup.

Runtime startup responsibilities include:

```text
verify boot-profile hash inputs
load prebuilt route/security/schema artefacts
load eager production packages only
defer optional AI/search/report/benchmark packages until after readiness
warm safe validators and runtime tables
deny secret caching
emit startup reports
```

Startup caches must be deterministic, non-secret, rebuildable, bounded and safe
to bypass. They must not be required for correctness.

## Structured Await Runtime

`logicn-core-runtime` should execute the lower-level mechanics behind LogicN Structured
Await while keeping those mechanics out of normal application code.

Runtime responsibilities include:

```text
create request/job/task scopes
schedule await all child work inside the parent scope
enforce await and await-group timeouts
propagate cancellation to unfinished children
apply race policies such as firstSuccess and firstResult
apply stream backpressure and max in-flight limits
dispatch network auto plans to the selected platform backend
emit runtime facts for async/concurrency reports
release resources when scopes end
```

The runtime may use futures, tasks, schedulers or polling internally, but those
types should remain package/runtime author APIs rather than the default LogicN
developer model.

## Controlled Recovery

`logicn-core-runtime` should distinguish item/data failures from system/runtime failures.

```text
item/data failure:
  may continue only when a resilient flow declares the policy

system/runtime failure:
  stop or restart safely, cancel children, release resources and report
```

Memory corruption, unsafe native failures and runtime integrity failures should
not continue blindly. Memory pressure can use controlled recovery such as
streaming mode, reduced batch size, backpressure, checkpointing or target
fallback.

## Memory Hierarchy and Reliability Facts

The runtime may report memory hierarchy and reliability facts when the platform
exposes them, such as cache line size, cache metadata or ECC status. It must not
claim direct control over CPU cache levels or ECC hardware.

When details are unavailable because the app is running in a container, VM,
managed host or restricted runtime, the runtime should report `unknown` rather
than guessing.

## Boundary

`logicn-core-runtime` executes LogicN code. It is not the secure application boundary.

```text
logicn-core-runtime
  executes checked or compiled LogicN code and Structured Await scopes

logicn-framework-app-kernel
  validates requests, checks auth, controls idempotency, rate limits, jobs and API policy

logicn-core-network
  defines network policy, profile, backend capability and report contracts
```

Final rule:

```text
logicn-core-runtime runs LogicN.
logicn-core-network describes network I/O contracts.
logicn-framework-app-kernel governs application/API runtime boundaries.
```
