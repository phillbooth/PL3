# LO App Template

This repository is a starter template for building a bespoke application using LO.

The project is split into package areas:

- `packages/lo-core/` - the LO language package, compiler rules, syntax notes and examples.
- `packages/lo-logic/` - LO multi-state logic concepts such as `Tri`, `Logic<N>` and future Omni logic.
- `packages/lo-vector/` - vector value, vector operation and vector report concepts.
- `packages/lo-compute/` - compute planning concepts shared across CPU, WASM, vector and hardware targets.
- `packages/lo-photonic/` - photonic and wavelength hardware concepts and mappings.
- `packages/lo-target-binary/` - binary/native target planning and artefact metadata.
- `packages/lo-target-photonic/` - photonic target backend planning that uses `lo-photonic`.
- `packages/lo-app-kernel/` - the optional secure runtime foundation for typed APIs, validation, auth, workload controls, jobs and reports.
- `packages/lo-api-server/` - the built-in HTTP API serving package for LO App Kernel.
- `packages/lo-cli/` - developer command tooling for checking, building, serving, reporting and task execution.
- `packages/lo-tasks/` - safe typed project automation and task execution.
- `packages/app/` - the bespoke application built with LO.
- `docs/` - app-specific planning, requirements, architecture and deployment notes.

## Layering

```text
LO Core
  language, compiler, type system, effects, memory safety, compute planning

LO Logic
  Tri, Logic<N>, Decision, RiskLevel, Omni logic and multi-state truth tables

LO Vector
  vector values, dimensions, lanes, operations and vector reports

LO Compute
  compute planning, capabilities, effects, budgets and target selection

LO Photonic
  wavelength, phase, amplitude, optical channels and photonic target mapping

LO Target Packages
  binary/native target planning and photonic backend planning

LO Standard Library
  Json, Xml, SafeHtml, File, Stream, Request, Response, DateTime, Money, SecureString

LO Secure App Kernel
  optional runtime layer for APIs, routing, validation, auth, rate limits, jobs and reports

LO Runtime
  future execution engine for compiled or checked LO code, separate from the app kernel

Full Frameworks
  CMS, admin UI, UI systems, templates, ORM, page builders and frontend adapters
```

## Git Layout

Current development uses one Git repository at the framework root:

```text
E:/projects/LO/.git
```

The intended future split is:

```text
light-framework/
|-- .git
|-- packages/
|   `-- .git
`-- app/framework files
```

Use that layout only when `packages/` becomes a reusable package collection that
is imported by different frameworks.

Recommended implementation:

```text
light-framework/.git
packages/.git
```

with `packages/` added to the framework as an intentional Git submodule or
standalone nested repository. Do not create `packages/.git` accidentally inside
the current app template, because the parent repository will not track package
contents in the normal way once `packages/` is its own repository.
