# LO App Template

### LO, short for Logic Omni

```text
Designed to be backwards compatible with binary while supporting photonic Tri logic.

Easy to code and learn for Humans

AI friendly syntax and mapping
```

This repository is a starter workspace for building a bespoke application with
LO.

A strict, memory-safe, 
security-first programming
language concept for API-heavy, JSON-native, 
AI-readable and accelerator-aware
software. This workspace keeps the LO language package, compiler/runtime
contracts, secure application kernel, developer tooling and app source in clear
package boundaries while the project is still being shaped.

## Status

LO is currently a language-design and v0.1 prototype project.

The mature language introduction lives in:

```text
packages/lo-core/README.md
```

The root of this repository is the workspace entry point. Use it to understand
how LO packages, app files, tooling, reports and generated project graph outputs
fit together.

The practical baseline is CPU-compatible checked execution and deterministic
developer tooling. GPU, low-bit AI, photonic, ternary and Omni-logic support are
package contracts, planning layers or simulation/report artefacts until real
backends exist.

## Core Ideas

LO is designed around:

```text
strict typing
explicit missing values
explicit errors
memory safety
security-first defaults
typed JSON and API contracts
source maps and machine-readable reports
AI-readable project context
CPU compatibility by default
optional accelerator planning
optional AI inference packages
```

LO avoids:

```text
undefined
silent null
truthy/falsy conditions
implicit type coercion
hidden exceptions as the default error model
raw pointers in normal code
compiled secrets
silent target fallback
framework-specific language syntax
mandatory future hardware
```

## Quick Start

From the repository root:

```powershell
cd C:\laragon\www\LO
```

Generate or refresh the project graph:

```powershell
node packages\lo-cli\dist\index.js graph --out build\graph
```

Inspect task automation with a dry run:

```powershell
node packages\lo-cli\dist\index.js task buildApi --file packages\lo-tasks\examples\tasks.lo --dry-run
```

Run the package tests that currently have executable coverage:

```powershell
npm.cmd --prefix packages\lo-project-graph test
npm.cmd --prefix packages\lo-tasks test
npm.cmd --prefix packages\lo-cli test
```

For the prototype LO core compiler, work from `packages/lo-core/` and see that
package README for the supported commands.

## Layering

```text
LO Core
  language, type system, effects, memory safety, syntax and core reports

LO Compiler / Runtime / Security / Config / Reports
  compiler pipeline, execution, shared security, configuration and report contracts

LO Logic / Vector / Compute / AI / Neural / Photonic / Target Packages
  specialised concepts and target planning outside the core language package

LO Secure App Kernel
  optional runtime layer for API validation, auth, rate limits, jobs and reports

LO API Server
  HTTP transport that normalises requests and calls the app kernel

LO CLI / Tasks / Project Graph
  developer tooling, safe automation and AI-readable project maps

Full Frameworks
  CMS, admin UI, page builders, ORMs, template engines and frontend adapters
```

Important boundary rules:

- `lo-core` defines the language. It must not become a web framework.
- `lo-app-kernel` is an optional secure application boundary. It must not become
  a CMS, admin dashboard, ORM or frontend framework.
- `lo-api-server` serves HTTP and delegates typed policy decisions.
- `lo-ai`, `lo-agent`, `lo-neural`, `lo-neuromorphic` and `lo-lowbit-ai` are
  optional AI package layers, not core syntax.
- Parallel agents must be supervised, bounded, permissioned and reportable.
- BitNet is a backend option inside low-bit AI, not a language feature.
- AI accelerators, GPUs and photonic chipsets are optional targets. CPU and
  binary-compatible fallback remain the baseline.
- `lo-project-graph` explains the repository. It does not enforce compiler,
  runtime or security rules.

## Current Tooling

The currently implemented root-level CLI paths are:

```powershell
node packages\lo-cli\dist\index.js graph --out build\graph
node packages\lo-cli\dist\index.js graph query lo-security --out build\graph
node packages\lo-cli\dist\index.js graph explain package:lo-security --out build\graph
node packages\lo-cli\dist\index.js graph path package:lo-project-graph report:project-graph --out build\graph

node packages\lo-cli\dist\index.js task --file packages\lo-tasks\examples\tasks.lo
node packages\lo-cli\dist\index.js task buildApi --file packages\lo-tasks\examples\tasks.lo --dry-run
```

Once `lo-cli` is installed or linked, the intended shorthand is:

```powershell
lo graph --out build\graph
lo task buildApi --dry-run
```

## Project Graph

AI assistants and developers should use the generated project graph to inspect
package ownership and repository relationships:

```text
build/graph/lo-project-graph.json
build/graph/LO_GRAPH_REPORT.md
build/graph/lo-ai-map.md
build/graph/lo-project-graph.html
```

If the graph is missing or out of date, regenerate it from the repository root:

```powershell
node packages\lo-cli\dist\index.js graph --out build\graph
```

The graph is navigation tooling only. It does not replace the compiler, tests,
security checks or package boundary rules.

## Task Automation

`lo-tasks` loads safe task definitions from `tasks.lo` files. Tasks declare
their dependencies, effects and permissions before anything runs.

Example:

```lo
task buildApi {
  depends [generateReports]
  effects [filesystem, compiler, reports]

  permissions {
    read "./src"
    write "./build"
  }
}
```

Current task execution supports loading, listing, dependency ordering, cycle
detection, dry-run planning, permission checks and task report generation.
Built-in operation execution is still future work.

Task reports are written by default to:

```text
build/reports/task-report.json
```

## Documentation Guide

- Use `packages/lo-core/` for language documentation.
- Use package READMEs and TODOs for package-specific contracts and work.
- Use `docs/` for app/workspace requirements, architecture, security,
  deployment, decisions and changelog.
- Use `AGENTS.md` for AI coding tool instructions.
- Update `docs/CHANGELOG.md` when architecture, tooling, package contracts or
  behavior changes.

## Git Layout

Current development uses one root Git repository while package boundaries are
still being shaped.

The intended future split is:

```text
light-framework/
|-- .git
|-- packages/
|   `-- .git
`-- app/framework files
```

Use that layout only when `packages/` becomes a reusable package collection that
is imported by different frameworks.

Recommended implementation:

```text
light-framework/.git
packages/.git
```

with `packages/` added to the framework as an intentional Git submodule or
standalone nested repository. Do not create `packages/.git` accidentally inside
the current app template, because the parent repository will not track package
contents in the normal way once `packages/` is its own repository.
