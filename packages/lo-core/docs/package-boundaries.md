# LO Package Boundaries

This document explains which LO concepts belong in `lo-core` and which concepts
belong in sibling packages.

`lo-core` should stay focused on the language, compiler-facing syntax, core type
rules, safety model, report contracts and examples needed to describe the
language.

It should not absorb every future LO package.

## Core Reference Policy

`lo-core` may reference sibling packages to explain boundaries, imports and
compiler report contracts.

`lo-core` should avoid owning package implementation details such as:

```text
HTTP server internals
auth provider implementation
task runner execution
benchmark runner implementation
project graph extraction implementation
photonic hardware backend code
binary emitter implementation
AI model runtime implementation
BitNet or other low-bit backend adapter implementation
vector runtime kernels
compute scheduler implementation
CLI command UX details
framework conventions
CMS/admin/frontend features
```

## Future Repository Split

The current workspace may keep packages in one root repository while boundaries
are still changing.

The future layout may split reusable packages into their own repository:

```text
light-framework/.git
light-framework/packages/.git
```

When that split happens, `lo-core` docs should continue to reference sibling
packages by package name and path, but implementation details should remain in
the owning package repository.
