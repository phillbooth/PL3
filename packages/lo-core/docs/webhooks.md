# Webhooks

LO should support secure webhook handling as a first-class API pattern.

## Required Defaults

```text
HMAC verification
replay protection
idempotency key support
payload size limits
typed JSON decoding
structured diagnostics
safe logging
secret redaction
```

## Rule

Webhook failures should return explicit errors and should never expose secrets in generated reports.

## Boundary

A `webhook` block is not a general API route group.

It is a secured inbound event boundary for provider callbacks such as payment events, subscription events, repository events or third-party system notifications.

Use `api` for normal request/response product routes.

Use `service` for listener ownership, health routes and mounting APIs or webhooks.

Webhook compiler checks should require:

```text
method
path
handler
payload size limit
signature or explicit development-mode override
replay protection or explicit development-mode override
idempotency key or explicit reason why replayed events are harmless
```

Duplicate webhook events should be handled through replay protection and
idempotency metadata. Detailed duplicate API, webhook duplicate and
idempotency planning lives in
`docs/api-duplicate-detection-and-idempotency.md`.
