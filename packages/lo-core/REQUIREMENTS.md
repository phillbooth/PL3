# LO Requirements

This document defines the initial requirements for **LO / Logic Omni**.

LO is a strict, memory-safe, security-first, JSON-native, API-native and accelerator-aware programming language concept.

The requirements in this document are intended to guide the design of the
language, compiler, optional Secure App Kernel contract, tooling,
documentation and future project structure.

---

## Requirement Levels

Requirements are grouped using the following labels:

| Level | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `MUST` | Required for the core LO concept |
| `SHOULD` | Strongly recommended, but may be phased in |
| `MAY` | Optional or future-facing |
| `LATER` | Not required for early prototypes |

---

## Core Requirement Summary

LO must support:

```text
.lo source files
strict type checking
memory safety
security-first defaults
explicit error handling
explicit missing-value handling
JSON-native development
API-native development
source maps
compiler reports
AI-readable context files
multi-target compilation planning
CPU binary compatibility
GPU planning
photonic planning
ternary simulation
secure runtime configuration
```

The build folder should also include `app.memory-report.json` and
`docs/memory-pressure-guide.md` when runtime memory policy is enabled.

LO core defines language safety. Runtime enforcement for request handling,
auth, rate limits, idempotency, jobs and workload control belongs in the
optional LO Secure App Kernel. Built-in HTTP API serving belongs in
`packages/lo-api-server/`, which should load route manifests and delegate to the
kernel. Full frameworks should build above or beside that kernel.

Specialised LO concepts belong in sibling packages. `lo-core` may define syntax,
compiler checks and report contracts for them, but detailed package semantics
must be updated in the owning package first:

```text
packages/lo-logic
packages/lo-vector
packages/lo-compute
packages/lo-ai
packages/lo-bitnet
packages/lo-photonic
packages/lo-target-cpu
packages/lo-cpu-kernels
packages/lo-target-binary
packages/lo-target-photonic
packages/lo-app-kernel
packages/lo-api-server
packages/lo-cli
packages/lo-tasks
```

---

## Backend Language Evolution Requirements

### REQ-EVOLUTION-001: Language Editions

LO SHOULD define language editions before major syntax growth.

Editions SHOULD be declared in project metadata:

```LO
language {
  edition "2026"
  compatibility "stable"
}
```

Edition changes MUST be reported in build manifests, source maps, diagnostics
and AI context.

---

### REQ-EVOLUTION-002: Compatibility and Deprecation Policy

LO SHOULD provide a compatibility policy for syntax, reports, targets and
runtime contracts.

Deprecations SHOULD produce warnings and fix suggestions before removals.
Breaking changes SHOULD be edition-gated.

---

### REQ-EVOLUTION-003: Algebraic Variants and Exhaustive Match

LO SHOULD treat enums, sealed variants and exhaustive `match` as core language
safety features.

The compiler SHOULD reject incomplete matches for closed state sets such as
`Option<T>`, `Result<T, E>`, `Decision`, `Tri` and declared sealed variants.

---

### REQ-EVOLUTION-004: Generic Constraints and Protocols

LO SHOULD support explicit generic constraints for reusable backend, numeric,
JSON and target-compatible code.

The design SHOULD avoid hidden implicit resolution. Constraints must be visible
to humans, compilers and AI tools.

---

### REQ-EVOLUTION-005: Structured Concurrency, Cancellation and Streams

LO SHOULD define structured concurrency primitives, cancellation propagation,
timeouts and typed streams.

These features are required for backend services, long-running workers,
streaming JSON, network I/O and safe shutdown.

---

### REQ-EVOLUTION-006: Deterministic Resource Cleanup

LO SHOULD define deterministic cleanup for resources such as files, sockets,
locks, temporary directories and foreign handles.

Cleanup behaviour MUST be source-mapped and must not hide errors.

---

### REQ-EVOLUTION-007: Safe Metadata and Compile-Time Transforms

LO MAY support safe compile-time metadata, attributes or hygienic transforms.

Metadata and transforms MUST NOT bypass source maps, effects, permissions,
security reports or AI reports.

---

### REQ-EVOLUTION-008: C ABI and Foreign-Call Boundary

LO MAY support C ABI import/export and foreign calls.

Foreign calls MUST declare types, effects, permissions, target compatibility
and unsafe boundaries. Raw pointers MUST remain unavailable in normal LO code.

---

### REQ-EVOLUTION-009: Shape-Aware Matrix and Vector Types

LO SHOULD support shape-aware vectors, matrices and tensors where practical.

Shape checks SHOULD happen at compile time where possible. Scalar fallback and
target compatibility reports are required for accelerated compute.

---

### REQ-EVOLUTION-010: Stable Diagnostics and AI Report Schemas

LO MUST keep diagnostics and AI report schemas stable enough for tools.

Diagnostic output SHOULD include stable IDs, severity, category, source
location, problem, why, suggested fix and safe examples where appropriate.

---

## Project File Requirements

### REQ-PROJECT-001: Use `.lo` Source Files

LO source files MUST use the `.lo` extension.

Examples:

```text
boot.lo
main.lo
order-service.lo
payment-webhook.lo
fraud-check.lo
```

### REQ-PROJECT-002: Project Entry File

A LO project SHOULD use:

```text
boot.lo
```

as the main project entry file.

Simple projects MAY use:

```text
main.lo
```

For consistency, `boot.lo` is preferred for full applications.

---

### REQ-PROJECT-003: Short Script Mode

LO MUST support short scripts without a full project structure.

Example:

```text
hello.lo
```

Command:

```bash
LO run hello.lo
```

Short scripts MUST use secure defaults:

```text
strict types enabled
memory safety enabled
undefined denied
silent null denied
unsafe denied
source maps enabled
CPU target enabled
```

---

### REQ-PROJECT-003A: Run Mode and Compile Mode

LO SHOULD support both direct Run Mode and full Compile Mode.

```text
Run Mode      = quick execution for scripts, learning and development
Compile Mode  = full production build with reports, manifests and target outputs
```

Run Mode MUST remain checked. It MUST NOT allow loose typing, undefined values,
silent null, secret printing or unsafe memory behaviour.

Compile Mode SHOULD generate:

```text
target outputs
source maps
map manifests
security reports
target reports
API reports
AI guides
AI context JSON
build manifests
generated documentation
```

LO SHOULD generate `app.execution-report.json` and
`docs/run-compile-mode-guide.md` for builds that declare execution policy.

Recommended rule:

```text
Run fast while developing.
Compile fully before deploying.
```

---

### REQ-PROJECT-003B: Strict Global Registry

LO SHOULD use local variables by default and require project-wide values to be
declared in a strict global registry.

The registry SHOULD support:

```text
const
config
secret
state
```

Global values MUST have explicit types. Secret globals MUST use `SecureString`
and MUST be redacted in reports, generated documentation, source maps and AI
context. Mutable shared state MUST be declared as controlled `state`.

LO SHOULD generate:

```text
app.global-report.json
docs/global-registry-guide.md
```

The build manifest SHOULD include a hash of the global registry structure and
required environment variables without including secret values.

Recommended rule:

```text
Local by default.
Global by declaration.
Mutable only by controlled state.
Secrets always protected.
```

---

### REQ-PROJECT-004: Project Mode

LO SHOULD support full project mode.

Recommended structure:

```text
my-LO-app/
├── boot.lo
├── LO.config
├── LO.lock
├── .env.example
├── src/
├── app/
├── components/
├── packages/
├── vendor/
├── config/
├── public/
├── storage/
├── tests/
└── build/
```

---

## Language Safety Requirements

### REQ-SAFETY-001: Strict Types

LO MUST be strictly typed.

The language MUST NOT allow loose type coercion.

Invalid:

```LO
let total = "10" + 5
```

Valid:

```LO
let total: Int = toInt("10") + 5
```

Strict typing MUST apply to:

```text
strings
numbers
money
dates
times
booleans
Tri
Omni
decisions
errors
JSON payloads
matrix shapes
tensor shapes
security permissions
hardware targets
```

---

### REQ-SAFETY-002: No JavaScript-Style Undefined

LO MUST NOT include JavaScript-style `undefined`.

Missing values MUST be explicit.

Required type:

```LO
Option<T>
```

Example:

```LO
let customer: Option<Customer> = findCustomer(customerId)

match customer {
  Some(c) => processCustomer(c)
  None => return Review("Customer missing")
}
```

---

### REQ-SAFETY-003: No Silent Null

LO MUST NOT allow silent null behaviour.

The language SHOULD avoid `null` in normal application logic.

Missing values MUST use:

```LO
Option<T>
```

---

### REQ-SAFETY-004: Explicit Error Handling

LO MUST support explicit error handling.

Functions that can fail SHOULD return:

```LO
Result<T, Error>
```

Example:

```LO
flow loadOrder(id: OrderId) -> Result<Order, OrderError> {
  let order = database.findOrder(id)

  match order {
    Some(o) => return Ok(o)
    None => return Err(OrderError.NotFound)
  }
}
```

Unhandled errors MUST fail compilation.

---

### REQ-SAFETY-005: No Truthy/Falsy Logic

LO MUST NOT allow accidental truthy/falsy checks.

Invalid:

```LO
if order.payment.status {
  shipOrder(order)
}
```

Valid:

```LO
match order.payment.status {
  Paid => shipOrder(order)
  Pending => holdForReview(order)
  Failed => cancelOrder(order)
  Unknown => holdForReview(order)
}
```

---

### REQ-SAFETY-006: Explicit Mutability

Values SHOULD be immutable by default.

Mutable values MUST be explicit.

Immutable:

```LO
let name: String = "Order 123"
```

Mutable:

```LO
mut count: Int = 0
count = count + 1
```

---

## Memory Safety Requirements

### REQ-MEMORY-001: Memory Safety by Default

LO MUST be memory safe by default.

The language MUST protect against:

```text
use-after-free
double free
buffer overflow
out-of-bounds access
dangling pointers
data races
uninitialised memory
unsafe shared mutation
null pointer errors
```

---

### REQ-MEMORY-002: No Raw Pointers in Normal Code

LO MUST NOT allow raw pointers in normal application code.

Any low-level memory feature MUST require explicit unsafe permissions.

---

### REQ-MEMORY-003: Unsafe Denied by Default

Unsafe behaviour MUST be denied by default.

Example project rule:

```LO
security {
  unsafe "deny"
}
```

Unsafe code MAY be considered later for specialist runtime/compiler internals, but it MUST NOT be part of normal LO application development.

---

### REQ-MEMORY-004: Bounds Checking

Arrays, buffers and collections MUST be bounds checked.

Out-of-bounds access MUST fail safely with a source-mapped error.

---

### REQ-MEMORY-005: Data Race Prevention

LO MUST include safe concurrency rules to avoid data races.

Shared mutable state MUST be restricted, protected or explicitly declared.

---

### REQ-MEMORY-006: Runtime Memory Pressure and Spill Policy

LO SHOULD allow projects to declare runtime memory pressure behaviour in
`boot.lo`.

Runtime memory configuration SHOULD support:

```text
soft memory limits
hard memory limits
ordered pressure actions
optional encrypted spill storage
spill TTL
spill disk limits
spill allow lists
spill deny lists
secret redaction
```

Spill storage MUST be allow-list based. Sensitive values MUST NOT spill to disk.

Required deny-list examples:

```text
SecureString
RequestContext
SessionToken
PaymentToken
PrivateKey
```

If runtime spill is enabled, LO SHOULD report the policy in:

```text
app.runtime-report.json
app.memory-report.json
docs/runtime-guide.md
docs/memory-pressure-guide.md
app.ai-guide.md
app.ai-context.json
```

The memory report SHOULD include:

```text
memory pressure ladder
cache bypass behaviour
spill allow and deny rules
queue and channel overflow policy expectations
JSON stream spill expectations
compile-time memory policy checks
memory recommendations
```

A cache limit MUST NOT change correctness. The flow should calculate and return
the result, bypass cache storage and report the bypass.

---

## Security Requirements

### REQ-SECURITY-001: Security-First Defaults

LO MUST be secure by default.

Default rules SHOULD include:

```text
unsafe denied
undefined denied
silent null denied
implicit casts denied
truthy/falsy checks denied
secret logging denied
unhandled errors denied
source maps enabled
```

---

### REQ-SECURITY-002: SecureString

LO SHOULD include a `SecureString` type.

Example:

```LO
let apiKey: SecureString = env.secret("API_KEY")
```

`SecureString` MUST NOT be printable or loggable by default.

Invalid:

```LO
print(apiKey)
```

Compiler error:

```text
Cannot print SecureString.
Use explicit reveal() only inside an approved secure context.
```

---

### REQ-SECURITY-003: Runtime Secrets Outside Compiled Files

LO MUST NOT compile real secrets into build outputs.

Secrets MUST live in:

```text
.env files for local development
server environment variables
container secrets
cloud secrets managers
deployment platform secrets
```

Compiled files MUST be treated as non-secret.

Recommended rule:

```text
Compiled files are not secret.
Secrets live outside compiled files.
```

---

### REQ-SECURITY-004: Permissions

LO SHOULD support project-level permissions.

Example:

```LO
permissions {
  network "restricted"
  file_read "allow"
  file_write "restricted"
  environment "restricted"
  native_bindings "deny"
}
```

Packages SHOULD also declare permissions.

---

### REQ-SECURITY-005: Effect System

LO SHOULD support an effect system.

Example:

```LO
pure flow calculateTax(amount: Money<GBP>) -> Money<GBP> {
  return amount * 0.20
}
```

A `pure` flow MUST NOT:

```text
read files
write files
use network
read environment variables
access current time
generate random values
change global state
```

Example with effects:

```LO
flow sendEmail(email: Email) -> Result<Void, EmailError>
effects [network.external] {
  return mailer.send(email)
}
```

---

## JSON Requirements

### REQ-JSON-001: JSON-Native Language Design

LO MUST treat JSON as a first-class data format.

The language SHOULD support:

```text
typed JSON decoding
raw JSON handling
JSON schema generation
OpenAPI generation
streaming JSON parsing
partial JSON decoding
JSON Lines processing
JSON path access
canonical JSON output
safe redaction
schema validation
```

---

### REQ-JSON-002: JSON-Native but Strict

LO MUST NOT become loosely typed just because it supports JSON.

The rule SHOULD be:

```text
JSON is easy to receive.
JSON is easy to inspect.
JSON is easy to transform.
JSON is easy to output.
But production JSON should be decoded into strict LO types.
```

Preferred:

```LO
let order: CreateOrderRequest = json.decode<CreateOrderRequest>(req.body)
```

Allowed when needed:

```LO
let raw: Json = req.json()
let eventType: String = raw.path("$.type").asString()
```

---

### REQ-JSON-003: JSON Safety Limits

LO SHOULD support JSON safety policies.

Example:

```LO
json_policy {
  max_body_size 1mb
  max_depth 32
  duplicate_keys "deny"
  unknown_fields "warn"
  null_fields "deny"
  date_format "iso8601"
}
```

LO SHOULD protect against:

```text
huge payloads
deeply nested payload attacks
duplicate keys
unexpected null
wrong types
missing fields
unsafe number conversion
date parsing ambiguity
secret leakage in logs
schema drift
```

---

### REQ-JSON-004: Streaming JSON

LO SHOULD support streaming JSON for large payloads.

Example:

```LO
for item in json.stream<OrderItem>(req.body) {
  process(item)
}
```

This avoids loading large payloads fully into memory.

---

### REQ-JSON-005: JSON Lines

LO SHOULD support JSON Lines.

Example:

```LO
for event in jsonl.read<Event>("./events.jsonl") {
  process(event)
}
```

---

### REQ-JSON-006: JSON Schema Generation

LO SHOULD generate JSON schemas from LO types.

Example:

```bash
LO schema CreateOrderRequest
```

Output:

```text
build/schemas/create-order-request.schema.json
```

---

## API and Webhook Requirements

### REQ-API-001: API-Native Design

LO MUST be designed for modern API-heavy systems.

The language SHOULD support:

```text
REST APIs
webhooks
typed request bodies
typed response bodies
JSON schema generation
OpenAPI generation
HMAC signature verification
webhook replay protection
idempotency keys
request timeouts
request cancellation
payload size limits
rate limiting
retry policies
circuit breakers
worker pools
channels
backpressure
dead-letter queues
structured logging
safe secret redaction
```

---

### REQ-API-002: API Contracts

LO SHOULD support API contract declarations.

Example:

```LO
api OrdersApi {
  POST "/orders" {
    request CreateOrderRequest
    response CreateOrderResponse
    errors [ValidationError, PaymentError]
    handler createOrder
  }

  GET "/orders/{id}" {
    params {
      id: OrderId
    }

    response OrderResponse
    handler getOrder
  }
}
```

The compiler SHOULD generate:

```text
OpenAPI specification
JSON schemas
request validators
response validators
test mocks
API reports
```

---

### REQ-API-003: Webhook Declaration

LO SHOULD support first-class webhook declarations.

Example:

```LO
webhook PaymentWebhook {
  path "/webhooks/payment"
  method POST

  security {
    hmac_header "Payment-Signature"
    secret env.secret("PAYMENT_WEBHOOK_SECRET")
    max_age 5m
    max_body_size 512kb
    replay_protection true
  }

  idempotency_key json.path("$.id")
  handler handlePaymentWebhook
}
```

---

### REQ-API-004: Idempotency

LO SHOULD support idempotency keys for APIs and webhooks.

This is required because webhooks are often delivered more than once.

Example:

```LO
idempotency_key json.path("$.id")
```

---

### REQ-API-005: Replay Protection

LO SHOULD support replay protection for signed webhooks.

Webhook security SHOULD include:

```text
signature verification
timestamp validation
maximum age
idempotency
duplicate detection
body size limits
```

---

### REQ-API-006: API Contract Checking

The LO compiler SHOULD check that route handlers match declared request and response types.

If a handler returns the wrong response type, the compiler SHOULD fail.

Example error:

```text
Route POST /orders expects CreateOrderResponse.
Handler createOrder returns Order.

Suggestion:
Return JsonResponse<CreateOrderResponse>.
```

---

## Concurrency Requirements

### REQ-CONCURRENCY-001: Lightweight Tasks

LO SHOULD support lightweight tasks for concurrent work.

Example:

```LO
task fetchCustomer = async getCustomer(order.customerId)
task fetchStock = async getStock(order.items)

let customer = await fetchCustomer
let stock = await fetchStock
```

---

### REQ-CONCURRENCY-002: Parallel Blocks

LO SHOULD support structured parallel blocks.

Example:

```LO
parallel {
  customer = await CustomersApi.get(input.customerId)
  stock = await StockApi.check(input.items)
  risk = await RiskApi.score(input)
} timeout 5s catch error {
  return Err(ApiError.ExternalServiceFailed(error))
}
```

---

### REQ-CONCURRENCY-003: Channels

LO SHOULD support channels for event processing.

Example:

```LO
channel orders: Channel<OrderEvent> {
  buffer 1000
  overflow "reject"
  dead_letter "./storage/dead/orders.jsonl"
}
```

---

### REQ-CONCURRENCY-004: Worker Pools

LO SHOULD support worker pools.

Example:

```LO
worker OrderWorker count 8 {
  for event in orders {
    processOrderEvent(event)
  }
}
```

---

### REQ-CONCURRENCY-005: Backpressure

LO SHOULD support backpressure controls.

Backpressure options MAY include:

```text
reject
wait
drop_oldest
drop_newest
dead_letter
scale_worker
```

---

## Maths and Compute Requirements

### REQ-MATH-001: Maths-Oriented Types

LO SHOULD include maths-oriented types.

Examples:

```text
Vector<N, T>
Matrix<R, C, T>
Tensor<Shape, T>
Decimal
Money<Currency>
```

---

### REQ-MATH-002: Compile-Time Shape Checking

LO SHOULD support compile-time shape checking where possible.

Invalid:

```LO
Matrix<128, 256> * Matrix<128, 64>
```

Valid:

```LO
Matrix<128, 256> * Matrix<256, 64>
```

---

### REQ-MATH-003: Compute Blocks

LO MUST support compute blocks as a language concept.

Example:

```LO
compute target best {
  prefer photonic
  fallback gpu
  fallback cpu

  score = fraudModel(features)
}
```

Compute blocks SHOULD help the compiler identify accelerator-compatible workloads.

---

## Target Requirements

### REQ-TARGET-001: CPU Binary Target

LO MUST support normal CPU output.

Early implementations MAY begin with an interpreter before a real binary compiler exists.

Long-term output:

```text
app.bin
```

---

### REQ-TARGET-002: WebAssembly Target

LO SHOULD support WebAssembly output.

Output:

```text
app.wasm
```

---

### REQ-TARGET-003: GPU Planning Target

LO MUST include GPU as a first-class target concept.

Early output MAY be a plan file:

```text
app.gpu.plan
```

A real GPU backend MAY be added later.

---

### REQ-TARGET-004: Photonic Planning Target

LO MUST include photonic as a future accelerator target concept.

Early output SHOULD be a plan file:

```text
app.photonic.plan
```

A real photonic backend MAY be added later when hardware access becomes realistic.

---

### REQ-TARGET-005: Ternary Simulation Target

LO SHOULD support ternary / 3-way simulation.

Output:

```text
app.ternary.sim
```

---

### REQ-TARGET-006: Target Fallback

LO MUST support explicit target fallback.

Example:

```LO
compute target best {
  prefer photonic
  fallback gpu
  fallback cpu

  result = model(input)
}
```

Fallback decisions MUST be reported.

---

### REQ-TARGET-007: Target Reports

LO MUST generate target reports.

Output:

```text
app.target-report.json
```

The target report SHOULD explain:

```text
which targets passed
which targets failed
which targets used fallback
which compute blocks were compatible
which operations could not be accelerated
```

---

### REQ-TARGET-008: Accelerator Verification and Precision Reports

LO MUST treat accelerator output as local computation output.

LO MUST NOT imply that photonic, GPU, ternary or quantum targets produce
mysterious external data.

Accelerator output SHOULD be verifiable against CPU reference output where
practical.

Example:

```LO
compute target best verify cpu_reference {
  prefer photonic
  fallback gpu
  fallback cpu

  result = fraudModel(features)
}
```

LO SHOULD track practical accelerator risks:

```text
signal noise
precision loss
analogue drift
calibration errors
thermal effects
target mismatch
wrong fallback target
rounding differences
hardware-specific behaviour
```

The compiler/runtime SHOULD report:

```text
CPU reference result
accelerator result where available
precision difference
confidence level
fallback reason
source location
```

Output:

```text
app.precision-report.json
```

LO SHOULD define an accelerator error correction policy.

The policy SHOULD support:

```text
detecting divergence from CPU reference output
measuring precision difference
retrying transient target errors
falling back to the next declared target
falling back to CPU reference output when available
failing closed when tolerance is exceeded
routing uncertain security or business decisions to Review
```

LO MUST NOT claim hardware-level photonic error correction unless a real backend
provides it. Early versions SHOULD report correction policy and planned checks
rather than claiming runtime correction.

---

## Build Requirements

### REQ-BUILD-001: Multi-Stage Build Pipeline

LO MUST use a multi-stage build pipeline.

Recommended stages:

```text
1. Read project config
2. Load source files
3. Parse source
4. Build AST
5. Type-check
6. Security-check
7. Memory-check
8. Runtime memory/spill policy check
9. JSON/API contract check
10. Lower to intermediate representation
11. Optimise intermediate representation
12. Link modules
13. Split CPU/GPU/photonic-compatible workloads
14. Emit target outputs
15. Generate source maps
16. Generate map manifest
17. Generate reports
18. Generate documentation
19. Generate AI context files
```

---

### REQ-BUILD-002: Intermediate Representation

LO SHOULD compile into an intermediate representation before target output.

Short form:

```text
source → checked IR → optimised IR → target outputs
```

---

### REQ-BUILD-003: Build Output

LO SHOULD produce build output similar to:

```text
build/
├── app.bin
├── app.wasm
├── app.gpu.plan
├── app.photonic.plan
├── app.ternary.sim
├── app.openapi.json
├── app.api-report.json
├── app.runtime-report.json
├── app.target-report.json
├── app.security-report.json
├── app.failure-report.json
├── app.source-map.json
├── app.map-manifest.json
├── app.ai-guide.md
├── app.ai-context.json
├── app.build-manifest.json
└── docs/
    ├── api-guide.md
    ├── webhook-guide.md
    ├── type-reference.md
    ├── security-guide.md
    ├── runtime-guide.md
    ├── deployment-guide.md
    ├── ai-summary.md
    └── docs-manifest.json
```

---

### REQ-BUILD-004: Build Manifest

LO MUST generate a build manifest.

Output:

```text
app.build-manifest.json
```

The manifest SHOULD include:

```text
project name
project version
compiler version
build mode
target outputs
source hash
binary hash
dependency hashes
created timestamp
```

---

### REQ-BUILD-005: Map Manifest and Generated Documentation

LO SHOULD support required generated documentation and a map manifest as part
of the build contract.

This contract SHOULD be declared in `boot.lo`, not `main.lo`.

```text
boot.lo = project, build, config, target, report and documentation registry
main.lo = application entry point
```

Required generated outputs MAY include:

```text
app.map-manifest.json
app.global-report.json
app.runtime-report.json
app.memory-report.json
app.execution-report.json
app.ai-guide.md
docs/api-guide.md
docs/webhook-guide.md
docs/type-reference.md
docs/global-registry-guide.md
docs/runtime-guide.md
docs/memory-pressure-guide.md
docs/run-compile-mode-guide.md
docs/security-guide.md
docs/deployment-guide.md
docs/ai-summary.md
docs/docs-manifest.json
```

The map manifest SHOULD explain:

```text
which .lo files were compiled
which flows, APIs, webhooks and types exist
which routes map to which handlers
which source files map to generated outputs
which compute blocks map to CPU/GPU/photonic plans
which documentation files were generated
which source hashes produced the build
```

If a project declares documentation or map manifests as required and generation
fails, the build SHOULD fail.

The AI guide SHOULD be regenerated only after a successful compile. Failed
builds SHOULD write failure reports and SHOULD NOT overwrite the last valid AI
guide unless the project explicitly opts into that behaviour.

The AI guide SHOULD include enough build identity to prove what it describes:

```text
project
compiler version
source hash
build manifest path
compiled output path
AI context JSON path
guide hash in app.build-manifest.json
```

Build explanation principles:

```text
If LO can compile it, LO should be able to explain it.
If the code compiles, the AI guide should describe the code that actually compiled.
Compiled code should always come with generated explanation.
```

---

### REQ-BUILD-006: Deterministic Builds

LO SHOULD support deterministic builds.

The same source, dependencies and compiler version SHOULD produce the same build output.

---

## Source Map and Debugging Requirements

### REQ-DEBUG-001: Source Maps

LO MUST generate source maps.

Output:

```text
app.source-map.json
```

The source map MUST map compiled output errors back to original `.lo` files.

---

### REQ-DEBUG-002: Original File and Line Errors

Runtime and compile errors SHOULD include:

```text
original file
original line
original column
flow/function name
target output
suggested fix where possible
```

Example:

```text
Runtime error: PaymentStatus.Unknown was not handled.

Original source:
  app/services/order-service.lo:42:7

Suggestion:
  Add a match case for Unknown.
```

---

### REQ-DEBUG-003: Debug and Release Modes

LO SHOULD support debug and release build modes.

Debug builds SHOULD keep more metadata.

Release builds SHOULD optimise output and MAY strip internal symbols, while keeping optional separate source maps.

---

## AI-Friendly Requirements

### REQ-AI-001: AI Context Output

LO MUST include an AI context concept.

Suggested command:

```bash
LO ai-context
```

Suggested outputs:

```text
build/app.ai-context.json
build/app.ai-context.md
```

---

### REQ-AI-002: AI Explanation Mode

LO SHOULD include AI explanation mode.

Suggested command:

```bash
LO explain --for-ai
```

This command SHOULD produce compact explanations of:

```text
compiler errors
target failures
security warnings
API contract problems
JSON validation problems
source-map traces
```

Example:

```json
{
  "errorType": "TargetCompatibilityError",
  "target": "photonic",
  "file": "src/fraud-check.lo",
  "line": 18,
  "column": 12,
  "problem": "readFile cannot run inside a photonic compute block.",
  "why": "Photonic targets only support approved maths, tensor, matrix and model operations.",
  "suggestedFix": "Move readFile outside the compute block and pass the parsed data into the model."
}
```

---

### REQ-AI-003: Stable Grammar

LO SHOULD use a stable and predictable grammar.

The language SHOULD avoid having many different ways to express the same concept.

This helps:

```text
human readability
compiler implementation
AI assistance
documentation
debugging
```

---

### REQ-AI-004: Machine-Readable Reports

LO SHOULD produce machine-readable reports in JSON.

Examples:

```text
app.failure-report.json
app.security-report.json
app.target-report.json
app.api-report.json
app.ai-context.json
```

---

### REQ-AI-005: Token-Efficient Project Context

LO SHOULD reduce the need to paste large source files into AI tools.

AI context reports SHOULD summarise:

```text
entry file
routes
types
imports
permissions
targets
errors
changed files
suggested next actions
```

---

### REQ-AI-006: Strict Comments

LO SHOULD support strict comments using `/// @tag value`.

Strict comments SHOULD be:

```text
machine-readable
source-mapped
AI-context readable
checked by compiler or linter where practical
rejected or redacted if they contain literal secrets
```

Version 0.1 SHOULD extract strict comments into:

```text
AST reports
app.source-map.json
app.security-report.json
app.ai-context.json
app.ai-context.md
```

Version 0.1 SHOULD warn on obvious mismatches such as:

```text
@output not matching a flow return type
@effects not matching a flow effects declaration
@request or @response not matching an API route
@security requiring HMAC when a webhook has no HMAC declaration
@verify not matching a compute block verify mode
```

Version 0.1 SHOULD NOT require strict comments on every internal helper.
Required strict-comment coverage should be introduced gradually for public,
security, API, webhook, rollback and compute-target boundaries.

---

## Deployment Requirements

### REQ-DEPLOY-001: Build Once, Deploy Many

LO SHOULD support build-once, deploy-many deployment.

Flow:

```text
1. Build once
2. Generate hashes
3. Generate build manifest
4. Sign or verify artefact
5. Upload artefact
6. Deploy same artefact to multiple servers
7. Each server loads its own environment variables
8. Health check each server
9. Roll back if checks fail
```

---

### REQ-DEPLOY-002: Environment-Specific Runtime Config

The same compiled artefact SHOULD be usable across different environments.

Examples:

```text
local
staging
production
server A
server B
server C
```

Environment-specific values MUST live outside the compiled output.

---

### REQ-DEPLOY-003: Build Verification

LO SHOULD provide verification commands.

Example:

```bash
LO verify build/release/app.build-manifest.json
```

Verification SHOULD check:

```text
hashes
target outputs
source maps
dependency versions
security reports
```

---

## Decompilation and Reverse Engineering Requirements

### REQ-DECOMPILE-001: Honest Security Model

LO MUST assume compiled output can potentially be reverse engineered.

Compiled files MUST NOT be treated as secret.

---

### REQ-DECOMPILE-002: Release Hardening

LO MAY support release hardening features:

```text
symbol stripping
separate source maps
build signing
checksums
optional obfuscation
debug metadata separation
```

---

## Package and Dependency Requirements

### REQ-PACKAGE-001: Lockfile

LO SHOULD use a lockfile.

Recommended:

```text
LO.lock
```

The lockfile SHOULD record:

```text
dependency names
dependency versions
dependency hashes
package permissions
licence information
target compatibility
```

---

### REQ-PACKAGE-002: Package Permissions

Packages SHOULD declare permissions.

Example:

```LO
package_policy {
  allow_network false
  allow_file_write false
  allow_native false
  allow_unsafe false
}
```

---

### REQ-PACKAGE-003: Package Folders

Recommended structure:

```text
packages/ = LO ecosystem packages
vendor/   = external third-party code, native libraries, SDKs or generated files
```

### REQ-PACKAGE-004: LO Workspace Package Boundaries

LO package-specific behaviour SHOULD live in the owning package.

Ownership:

```text
lo-core              = language syntax, compiler contracts and core safety rules
lo-logic             = Tri, Logic<N>, Decision, RiskLevel and Omni logic
lo-vector            = vector values, dimensions, lanes and vector operations
lo-compute           = compute planning, capabilities, budgets and target selection
lo-ai                = generic AI inference contracts and safety policy
lo-bitnet            = BitNet-style 1.58-bit / ternary AI inference contracts
lo-photonic          = wavelength, phase, amplitude and optical signal concepts
lo-target-cpu        = CPU target capability and fallback planning
lo-cpu-kernels       = optimized CPU kernel contracts
lo-target-binary     = binary/native target planning and artefact metadata
lo-target-photonic   = photonic backend target planning
lo-app-kernel        = secure application/API runtime boundary
lo-api-server        = built-in HTTP transport package
lo-cli               = developer command-line tooling
lo-tasks             = safe project automation
```

If a change affects only package semantics, update that package documentation.
If a change affects `.lo` syntax, compiler validation, report schemas or package
registry behaviour, update `lo-core` documentation as well.

---

parser prototype
AST prototype
interpreter prototype
strict type checker concept
Option and Result concept
Decision type concept
JSON decoding concept
API contract concept
source-map format concept
security report format
target report format

```

Version 0.1 SHOULD NOT require:

```text
real photonic hardware
real GPU backend
full package manager
built-in full MVC framework
production compiler
formal verification
```

---

## Final Requirement Statement

LO must be practical, strict, safe and future-ready.

The language should provide immediate value through:

```text
strict types
memory safety
JSON-native development
API-native development
source maps
security reports
AI-friendly compiler output
normal CPU compatibility
```

It should prepare for future value through:

```text
GPU planning
photonic planning
ternary simulation
multi-target compilation
accelerator-aware compute blocks
```

The most important requirement is that LO must remain useful without future hardware, while being designed to support that future when it arrives.
